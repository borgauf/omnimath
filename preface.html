A key scene in the film <i><a href="https://youtu.be/v-pbGAts_Fg">Hidden Figures</a></i> has NASA&rsquo;s scientific team of
mathematicians, physicists, and engineers trying to figure out how to
get a space capsule orbiting around the Earth back on the ground. They
need to come up with the right math in order to transition the vehicle
from an elliptical orbit into a parabolic-shaped descent
path<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Technically speaking, a spacecraft orbiting the Earth is in an
<i>elliptic</i>, not circular orbit. And the path back to Earth after
breaking this orbit will resemble half of a parabola turned on its
side, hence, the adjective parabolic.
</span>. This is a rare moment in a Hollywood film where they
actually get the science right. That is to say,
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>

</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Why is this so special?  Because during the process of finding the
answer we see the math coming out of books, out of heads, and being
put to work on a real-world, life-or-death problem. The icing on the
cake is the depiction of the team getting their just-delivered IBM
mainframe computer (that no one knows how to run) to help them.

Fast-forward to today where <i>tens of billions</i> of computing devices
&#x2014; nearly all capable of running rings around that first NASA
computer &#x2014; are doing computations big and small in every corner of
the world. Yes, most of these calculations are relatively simple, but
many are quite complex. This is the sort of math that, pre-Computer
Age, would have been found only in dense books and dry collections of
tables, on classroom and office blackboards, embodied in mechanical
contraptions or analog electrical circuits, and, most mysteriously, as
&ldquo;mental representations&rdquo; in the brains of that small cadre of people
called <i>mathematicians</i>, <i>physicists</i> and <i>engineers</i>.

<p>
and, yes, giving a computer &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; is what we&rsquo;re doing with
programming<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
There are two general categories of &ldquo;giving instructions&rdquo;:
<i>imperative</i> with statements and <i>declarative</i> with expressions. Read
on.
</span>. And yet to this day we don&rsquo;t fully understand how
we humans convey knowledge, instructions to one another. Frankly, we
don&rsquo;t really know how one human teaches math to another. No surprise,
but it&rsquo;s likewise not obvious how we should &ldquo;do math&rdquo; on a
computer. Yes, at some stage of one human teaching, sharing math with
another human, the teacher and student get on the same page. The
student catches on, &ldquo;syncs up&rdquo; their understanding with the teacher&rsquo;s,
and the knowledge is duly conveyed, mathematical abstraction
grokked. Still, if we don&rsquo;t really understand how math is mentally
represented in a human brain, nor how one mental representation gets
reconstructed in another&rsquo;s brain, then adding the digital computer
into this mix makes everything even more mysterious and intriguing. In

<p>
Contrary to what various &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; promoters<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Most &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; initiatives are rushed oversimplifications
primarily geared towards only a narrow part of the huge and diverse IT
world. User-interface (UI) coding is emphasized, while the other
branches, e.g., data management, systems programming, and especially
computational-numerical programming aren&rsquo;t covered or are given
short-shrift.
</span> might say,
the programming part of this puzzle cannot simply be a stand-alone
boot camp-style cram session. <i>Oh no,</i> you might say, <i>there&rsquo;s already
so much math to learn, and here&rsquo;s yet another thing to learn!</i> Yes and
no. Yes, it will be challenging, but we believe teaching math with
code and the code with math will make both realms come alive and be
fun to learn. We&rsquo;ve seen this pairing make beautiful music together,
and we want to build on this winning combination<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
One huge inspiration for CIMIC is the book <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Classical_Mechanics">Structure and
Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a></i> by Gerald Jay Sussman, Jack
Wisdom, and Meinhard E. Mayer. And this was based in part on Donald
Knuth&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a></i> initiative, also championed by Timothy
Daly.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
So if computer programs are written in computer programming languages,
what language shall we write our code in? This may seem a
controversial choice to some, but we&rsquo;ll center on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>, a <i>typed,
purely functional</i><label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll dive into what a <i>typed</i> and <i>purely</i> functional language
is later&#x2026;
</span> language. One big reason Haskell is our
choice is that it is, beyond any doubt, the most math-centric,
math-conscious language there is. Pick up Haskell and it <i>oozes</i>
mathematical elegance<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Often enough, you can open a higher-level math text, e.g.,
abstract algebra, pick a topic, then Google <i>Haskell obscure abstract
algebra topic</i> and, chances are, somebody has explored a
code-is-math-is-code treatment of it, written libraries for it.
</span>. But why choose Haskell with its rather
steep learning curve? Why not, say, an easy-to-learn &ldquo;blub&rdquo; language?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#Blub">Blub</a> languages have earned this not-so-flattering name by <i>not</i> being
<i>functional</i> languages. What does that mean? Let&rsquo;s begin to unpack
this now.
</p>

<p>
When you write code in Blub, you are basically telling the computer
&#x2014; sometimes literally line-by-line &#x2014; what to do<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<i>Literally</i> line-for-line programming would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a>. But
many languages (e.g. C/C++) will have you explicitly, manually
managing your program&rsquo;s memory. That is to say, <i>memory management</i> is
done by the programmer and not automatically handled behind the scenes
as it now is in most modern languages. This is a hold-over from the
early days of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann machine</a>-based digital
computers of the 1950s.
</span>. This is
called <i>imperative</i> programming, i.e., each line is a command, a
statement, an imperative instruction. A functional language, on the
other hand, is based primarily on the mathematical concept of a
<i>function</i>. Functional languages are consider to be
<i>declarative</i><label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">this article</a> on declarative programming.
</span> languages where code can be considered
mathematical statements in the form of true mathematical
functions. One main advantage of being declarative and function-based
in a mathematical expression sense is that our code will conform to
math function behavior, that is, when we put something into a
computation we get back exactly <i>one</i> answer&#x2014;and not one answer now,
then perhaps a different, unexpected answer the next time because the
<i>state</i><label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll go into the details of <i>state</i> soon.
</span> of the program has changed. This might seem too
hair-splittingly abstract so early in our discussion, but functional
programming&rsquo;s only-one-output feature is an absolute necessity for
computational predictability<label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll discuss <i>referential transparency</i>, the technical term
for this idea, later, but in the
meantime you might want to take a crack at the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">here</a>.
</span>. Being able to know and trust your
code helps reduce bugs and errors that may crop up as rude surprises
when your program suddenly does something other than what you expected
it to do<label for="12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
It might be hard to get all of what Charles Scalfani is saying
in his <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">IEEE Spectrum</a> article <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">Why Functional Programming Should Be the
Future of Software Development</a>, but one easy take-away is that
non-functional languages don&rsquo;t scale well due to lack of referential
transparency and too much state juggling. A typical blub-written
project without referential transparency must rely in extensive
testing and debugging &#x2014; which can&rsquo;t always find all the worst-case
scenarios.
</span>. By the way, there&rsquo;s a very big push these days to make code
&ldquo;provable,&rdquo; i.e., guaranteed to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to and not what
it&rsquo;s not supposed to do. Typed functional languages like Haskell are
the base camp of this mountain.
</p>

<p>
Again, this only-one-answer predicability is built in to math
functions &#x2014; right?<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
When did you first hear about this? You probably don&rsquo;t
remember, but a hint would be, A vertical line is &ldquo;undefined.&rdquo; In a
future section we&rsquo;ll discuss middle-school math notions about
functions plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system versus
higher-math&rsquo;s more thorough treatment.
</span> Yes, of course it is! And why this is true
can be seen in how math defines functions. We&rsquo;ll soon take a
higher-math dive into exactly what a math function is and why it&rsquo;s so
important in functional programming.
</p>

<p>
So if not Blub, why not a CAS<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
CAS is short for <i>computer algebra system</i>. Wikipedia has a good
article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">here</a>.
</span>, i.e., a math software package
like <i>MatLab</i>, <i>Wolfram</i>, or <i>Maxima</i>, or a numerical package
available with Python such as <i>SymPy</i>? The short answer is we really
should learn to do hands-on programming. Why? Because software
packages with ready-made plug-and-chug solutions won&rsquo;t help us learn
to negotiate the real computationally-based STEM world. <i>But I&rsquo;ve
heard Python is very popular for math stuff</i>, you might say. For an
analogy, doing math with Python is like eating soup with a butter
knife (C++ with a steak knife). Haskell &#x2014; for many
reasons &#x2014; is like eating soup with a spoon. It&rsquo;s the best utensil.
</p>

<p>
Learning Haskell will fall into two categories: A) theory deep dives
and B) toolbox-building. A deep dive will take us on an exploration of
just how and why Haskell is doing something the way it does. There
definitely is math theory behind Haskell&rsquo;s ways, and we&rsquo;ll look into
some of method behind the seeming madness. Again, there&rsquo;s no other
language like Haskell<label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
&#x2026;except for its very worthy siblings in the typed functional
sphere SML, Ocaml, Purescript, and F#.
</span>. Toolbox-building, on the other hand,
will be more &ldquo;learn to code,&rdquo; only with Haskell, i.e., figuring out
what its syntax, semantics, its <i>first principles</i> hands-on. So yes,
with Haskell we&rsquo;ll be building and designing our own calculator, our
own CAS, but we&rsquo;ll go beyond calculation and into concepts.

<h3 id="org5700a24">Math is abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5700a24">
<p>
We believe anyone can do math, not because we&rsquo;re cheery, sunny
optimists, but because it&rsquo;s just a fact. But why then is math so
difficult to learn for so many people? We believe the learning
problems arise because
</p>

<p>
Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Luria">Alexander Luria</a>&rsquo;s groundbreaking
studies of the IQs of pre-literate people in the Caucus Mountains,
we&rsquo;ve gradually come to see abstraction as a much more complicated
beast than before<label for="16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See <a href="https://youtu.be/9vpqilhW9uI">James Flynn</a>&rsquo;s TED talk, and read the first chapter of James
Gleick&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood">The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</a></i>.
</span>. Long story shortened, math can be a very
imposing vertical wall of abstraction. And, as Luria discovered, there
may exist social and cultural biases, actual social-psychological
resistance <i>against</i> abstraction that we&rsquo;ve imbued from our
milieu. We cannot simply assume that any and all abstraction and
symbolism can and will be instantly grokked by our math
audience<label for="17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="17" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The classic line, &ldquo;What is this for? Why are we doing this?&rdquo;
is the elephant in the middle of the math classroom.
</span>. But if we approach the abstraction curve with respect
for its difficulty and steepness <i>and</i> we don&rsquo;t resort to force or
hand-waving<label for="18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="18" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
To <i>hand-wave</i> in science is to dismiss or downplay
complexity, to skip over or sweep something difficult under the
rug. We will avoid hand-waving at all costs.
</span>, we can master deeper symbolism and abstraction. We
must build up our abstraction receptor sites in our brains, so to
speak.
</p>

<p>
By the way, mathematics is just as much about words as it is about
numbers and formulae. Of course some math doesn&rsquo;t require any
words. There is the story of an American math professor who
&ldquo;translated&rdquo; Russian math books &#x2014; without understanding a word of
Russian. But that is very rare. A typical upper-level math text on,
e.g., abstract algebra or real analysis, will have the reader
weighing, pondering every word in every sentence, over and over. You
may spend a week trying to wrap your head around just one page of one
chapter. Hence, we need to develop a very sharp, precise and exacting
focus on what words really mean, what they really imply. <i>And</i> we need
to expand our math and computer science vocabulary. A doctor who had
just graduated from medical school once said his school had emphasized
to what seemed an extreme degree knowing terminology, remembering
sheer masses of words. This will be similar. Because if we get the
words and their precise meaning down &#x2014; the learning will go much
smoother. Otherwise, every sentence risks becoming bogged down in
ambiguity and confusion.

<p>
Human vision happens in parallel. All the objects in our field of
vision hit our eyes and brain all at once, in parallel &#x2014; and our
brain knows what to do. However, we speak, hear, learn serially. That
is to say, we receive words as a stream, a string, one element at a
time, one atom of information after the other. Math is mainly
serial. We <i>read</i> math texts from left-to-right. We read math proofs
top to bottom. And if you don&rsquo;t understand something in a math lecture
early on &#x2014; you might very well be lost for the rest of the
lecture. That&rsquo;s because the lecture is coming at you in serial, and
<font color = "#650d1c">everything happening right now is
dependent on your having understood what came before.</font>
Therefore, everything written, language or math, is one piece after
the next; and it&rsquo;s then up to our minds to take in the serial stream
and process it properly into some mental representation whole.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, a human mental representation of math can be a very
amorphous, quasi-parallel beast. Really, we don&rsquo;t know much about how
the human mind houses and processes math. So if math on a chalkboard
or in a book is like sheet music notes on a page, how do we &ldquo;play&rdquo;
math? <font color = "#650d1c">Today, we are increasingly

One big, <i>big</i> mistake in the teaching and learning of math is
<i>conditioning</i>. When circus animal trainers train (torture) their
animals, they simply repeat routines over and over (under duress)
until the animal finally complies. Does the rat being forced to
negotiate a maze or the lion to jump through a burning hoop know,
understand what the idea, the concept, the purpose is? No. They&rsquo;re
simply in a stimulus-response <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism#21st-century_behaviorism_(behavior_analysis)">behaviorist</a> loop.
</p>

<p>
This sort of human behaviorist conditioning can be in the form of
<i>rote</i> learning &#x2014; which everyone agrees these days is not the best
way. And yet we hear over and over, in one form or another,
&ldquo;<font color = "#650d1c">When you see this kind of thing, you
do this.</font>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mathematician <a href="https://longformmath.com/">Jay Cummings</a> calls this <i>The Way</i>. So in your math class
you start a new topic and you are shown <i>The Way</i> to handle it. You
see The Way used in examples, then The Way is employed to solve the
exercises at the end of the chapter. And when you see problems of this
topic on a test, you use The Way. But learning math by simply piling
up as many The Ways as possible rarely leads to any deeper
understanding of math, let alone its purpose, let alone its aesthetics
or beauty.
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s the alternative to rote, behaviorist conditioning, to The Way?
Best is concept-based learning, getting above the details into
carefully constructed, carefully worded, carefully delineated
generalizations where similarities and patterns can be grouped and
mentally aggregated into a deeper understanding. Another technique is
to simply <i>triangulate</i>, i.e., hit the problem from different angles,

<h3 id="org20e96eb">Editorial rant: The precarious state of STEM</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org20e96eb">
<p>
The American public K-12 math curriculum is designed to be a smooth,
gradual on-ramp for further math, physics, and engineering studies at
the college level. This strategy started back in the Cold War Era when
we freaked out over being behind the Russians when they were the first
to put a satellite in orbit in 1957. The so-called &ldquo;Sputnik crisis&rdquo;
resulted in a scramble to improve American math, science, and
engineering. Problematic is how today in the twenty-first century this
mid-twentieth-century curriculum does practically nothing to prepare
students for the ever-growing, evermore-important sector of applied
computational math and computer science. Today&rsquo;s incoming college
Freshmen choosing computer science are confronted with many strange
and alien concepts they&rsquo;ve never seen before, the main one being
<i>discrete</i> mathematics<label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll learn plenty about discrete math as we go. But for a
quick introduction, consider a light switch that goes on or
off. That&rsquo;s two <i>discrete</i> states. The opposite of discrete would be
<i>continuous</i>. So think of a volume control knob on your radio,
<i>continuous</i> in that it <i>continually</i> changes, i.e., the change is so
small and incremental that they seem to blend together into one
<i>continuous</i> sweep from soft to loud.
</span>. Without any previous exposure to the
specialized math of computer science, the first two, three, four
semesters of a college comp-sci degree are typically a quick-time
march to catch up<label for="21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="21" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Imagine wanting to study math in college after having seen
absolutely <i>no</i> math K-12. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>
has taken steps to narrow this gap. Much of their math curriculum
attempts to expose kids to a discrete math, if not a computer algorithm
way of seeing math. But in our humble opinion it&rsquo;s far too little.
</span>. The result is, nation-wide, high
drop-out/flunk-out rates in CS departments&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but not necessarily at the elite universities with their
90th-percentile students<label for="22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="22" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
&#x2026;as I refer to them the <i>big boys and girls</i> who can do the
&ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo;&#x2026;
</span>. At the world-class STEM schools the
pace is fast and furious, but the majority survive. At the
second-tier schools, however, this sort of pace usually isn&rsquo;t
maintained and corners are cut. And so a two-tiered world has emerged,
one group getting a solid CS education, the other getting a watered
down, vocational school version of CS. Here we will attempt to build
an on-ramp to computational/numerical math alongside, complimented by
coding that is, in turn, grounded back into solid math and computer
science. To accomplish this we&rsquo;ll explore the world of discrete math,
algorithms<label for="23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="23" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of <i>algorithms</i>. Very simply put, an
algorithm is a set of instructions, perhaps like a baking recipe, that
produces a mathematical cake. In computational math, we&rsquo;re basically
redoing, reimagining math formulae as algorithms which then can run on
computers. Lots and lots more about algorithms as we move along.
</span>, data structures, and numerical applications
parallel to their underlying mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Of course when the math and the code march together, the pace can slow
appreciably, since we might need to take get-up-to-speed side
trips. We&rsquo;ll often say, &ldquo;Check out this tutorial,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll follow a
link to an online resource and start supplemental &ldquo;appendix&rdquo;
learning. Of course whether or not you follow our advice, as well as
the level to which you grok it will be up to you. But expect
<i>rabbit-holing</i><label for="24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="24" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
&ldquo;Down the rabbit hole&rdquo; is a concept borrowed from <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i> to mean going into a strange, new world of excitement and
challenge.
</span> from now on. We&rsquo;re all about <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first</a></i>
learning<label for="25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="25" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
But of course we run the risk of &ldquo;getting lost in the weeds.&rdquo;
Beware of the endlessly bifurcating rabbit hole. From the Wikipedia
article: <i>&#x2026;In contrast, (plain) depth-first search, which explores the node</i>
<i>branch as far as possible before backtracking and expanding other</i>
<i>nodes, may get lost in an infinite branch and never make it to the</i>
<i>solution node.</i>
</span>, not <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a></i>. Typically, breadth-firsters want
to avoid &ldquo;getting lost in the weeds.&rdquo; Unfortunately, weeds are not to
be avoided in STEM, and you should develop experience in balancing
just how much weed-whacking you need to do in order to resume your
main investigation with insight and confidence. In the beginning, what
we offer here on-site will seem like just the tip of the iceberg, the
rest of the learning experience happening down off-site rabbit holes
(R-hole). Again, this is quite necessary and unavoidable in order to
understand best how math can be recast into real-world code for
real-world applications. Rabbit-holing is definitely a part of
real-world STEM.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll have a rating system for rabbit holes: a <i>critical</i> or
<i>compulsory</i> rabbit hole (R<sub>C</sub>-hole) is a hole you really need to go
down, material you absolutely need to learn; an <i>optional</i> rabbit hole
(R<sub>O</sub>-hole) would help with the material but is not absolutely
necessary; and an <i>FYI</i> rabbit hole (R<sub>FYI</sub>-hole) is a good source for
expanding your understanding, but isn&rsquo;t necessary to keep moving
along. When appropriate, a list of R-holes with the üêá symbol will be
listed at the top of topic headings. (Note: smaller, side excursions
will simply be links or side notes in the text.)

<p>
No doubt the typical, standard public school K-12 math curriculum is a
well thought out, gentle and gradual on-ramp for most higher-ed STEM
studies. But we won&rsquo;t always be so gradual. Often enough we&rsquo;ll be
&ldquo;deep end,&rdquo; as in throw you in the. <i>Sounds brutal</i>, you say, <i>Are you
sure that&rsquo;s the best approach?</i>
</p>

<p>
As approaches go, deep end is pretty much a given in the real STEM
world. Rarely will a new task or project be something you already know
everything about, something you can simply shake out of your sleeve in
no time then go home early. Rather, the STEM real world is all about
being baffled, out of your depth, overwhelmed &#x2014; until you back off,
take a few breaths, begin to think it through, pick it apart, try this

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3fa6762">
<p>
Real-world work requires real-world tools. The first casualty of this
logos is that we eschew &ldquo;graphing calculators.&rdquo; Why? <font
color = "#650d1c">Because graphing calculators simply are not used
in real-world STEM.</font> Instead, we will use a combination

</p>

<p>
Another perhaps controversial stance is we will not use commercial,
proprietary software. Instead, we&rsquo;ll base everything we&rsquo;re doing on
free software. Why? Because nearly all software used in STEM today
<i>is</i> in fact free-software based. Really?! Yes! <i>All cutting-edge STEM

the tipping-point reasons for this decision is the Linux command line
environment; we feel everyone should get some experience with it.

<p>
We&rsquo;ll also use the <i>Emacs</i> text editor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a><label for="29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="29" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

is unprecedented. No other IDE or editing environment comes close to

<h3 id="orgc9f896a">The journey ahead; where are we going?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc9f896a">
<p>
Where are we going? What do we expect to achieve? The Computer Age has
forced a split between what is now known as <i>continuous</i> math, i.e.,
the math of physics and engineering; and <i>discrete</i> math, the math
brought to the fore by the theoretical implications and requirements
of computers. We know what continuous math is &#x2014; as we&rsquo;ve mentioned,
the world&rsquo;s K-12 math curriculum is all over it. And we can readily
see what it does, i.e., the modern technology all around us. But where
is the computer-led side of science and technology going? Many today
might say into AI, <i>artificial intelligence</i>. But teaching a computer
to really think has proven to be an elusive goal. The following joke
will illuminate
</p>

<p>
<i>Two people are walking along the beach when one says, &ldquo;Look! A dead seagull!&rdquo; The other looks up into the sky and says, &ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
Of course this is humorous because we consider it daft for someone to
think that just because seagulls are birds spending most of their
lives sailing the coastal breezes, that when one dies it would remain
aloft. But a computer scientist might not laugh. Why? Because of the
concept of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical entailment</a></i> (LE). In our joke, the logic of a dead
bird no longer being able to fly is simply taken for granted. However,
if we are trying to program a computer to have what we consider
intelligence we must tell it literally everything it would need to
know. We simply cannot expect it to deduce, infer facts that are not
deducible or LEs of the explicitly given facts<label for="30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="30" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Here&rsquo;s an example of LE. If we said \(\lnot\; a = \lnot\; a\;\)
and that \(\lnot\; \lnot\;a = a\;\) what can we infer that \(\lnot\) is
doing to \(a\;\)?
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Consider this sequence of objects: <font color = "#650d1c">
\(\{1,\; nickel,\; 10,\; quarter, \;50, \;?\}\;\;\;\)
</font>. What should the last element &ldquo;?&rdquo; be?  Having
experience with these sorts of aptitude test questions, most of us
would say &ldquo;dollar.&rdquo; But to know that &ldquo;dollar&rdquo; completes the sequence
assumes much LE. A whole lot of facts must be in place
before we have the necessary knowledge base to figure this out. The
bottom line is, in the computer world you must build logical
entailment up very thoroughly, leaving nothing out.
</p>

<p>
Once we&rsquo;ve got some experience under our belts, we&rsquo;ll notice that the
numerous side trips, the rabbit-holing and woodshedding to fill in
gaps will decrease &#x2014; simply because we already know stuff and we&rsquo;re
getting the hang of things. As a result our turnaround time on getting
things done will shorten. Still, it will always be hard. STEM will
always be a tough and challenging uphill battle, but a very good, very
rewarding one at the end of the day. In short, we think it&rsquo;s the best,
the most noble path there is. And so with no further ado, let&rsquo;s start.

<h3 id="org13b6499">Novalis Technical Preparatory School</h3>

<p>
CIMIC will follow the learning arc of the (fictitious) von der
Surwitzes siblings, twins Ute and Uwe, and one-year-younger
sister Ursula. Their father, Dr. Leopold von der Surwitz, is a chemical
engineering professor at the local university, and their mother,
Dr. Julia von der Surwitz, is a statistics researcher employed by the
Max Plank Institute of Biophysics, now working mainly online. The
family was originally from Kiel in the north of Germany and have been
in the U.S.A going on their second year.
</p>

<p>
The children attend the university&rsquo;s satellite prep school Novalis
Tech and are taking a class called <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i>
from Dr. Ishika Chandra, a professor of computer science at the local
university. Her goal is to familiarize the students with the sorts of
topics a typical incoming university Freshman student would face in
their first year in a Computer Science program<label for="31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="31" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
If anyone is bothered about why we&rsquo;re not being more woke/PC,
hey, we&rsquo;re just being realistic. After all, who in the U.S. would be
teaching and taking such computer science prep material other than
Asian and European transplants in such an especially pro-academic,
learning safe zone environment? But maybe we can turn this sorry state
of affairs around, eh? There are plenty of empty chairs around the
STEM table begging for new participants from all walks of life.
</span>.

<span class="cap">Grandma von der Surwitz back in Berlin likes to go to the museum and look at this picture to be reminded of her grandchildren in America.</span>

<p>
Novalis Tech is unique in that there are no preset curricula or
classes, no Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior breakdown; rather,
learning paths are completely customized for each student. And only in
special cases does the teacher-student ratio go above
one-to-four. Professor Chandra&rsquo;s <i>Intro to Comp-Sci</i> is an exception
in that she has the von der Surwitzes, her own child, Liya, and three
other students, Cathy, Ralph, and Jim. In other words, she&rsquo;s running a
university-style course. Things started during the Novalis Prep summer
camp in mid-July where the kids met with the professor and talked
about the upcoming course. Then they had a proper sit-down discussion
at the Novalis Prep Open House on campus in late July. Typical of the
Novalis Tech way, the von der Surwitzes start with the rabbit holes
the following Monday, a full month before Novalis Tech classes
officially begin.
</p>

<p>
Novalis Tech is also unique in that there is a team of adult &ldquo;learning
coaches,&rdquo; typically retirees, who are like personal fitness trainers,
only for academics. Often enough, the coach and the student will be
team-learning a topic or team-constructing a project
together. Students check in at least once per week with their learning
coach, going over their custom education plan; and at least once per
month a student will give a lecture on their progress, before just
their coach, a group of coaches, or groups of students and coaches and
faculty.
</p>

<p>
Professor Chandra maintains a GitHub repository for the course
containing lectures, annotations, code, and various supplementary
materials. The students clone her repo and make their own additions,
then other class members are able compare their work and
alterations. What is not done in Emacs org-mode is \(\LaTeX\:\). The
lectures, as well as the lecture&rsquo;s code examples are Emacs org-mode
files using <i>Babel</i> source blocks for code. The students would open
this file in Emacs, run the <code>tangle</code> command, which would produce a
separate Haskell <code>.hs</code> file that they could load at a ghci REPL
prompt. Again, they are encouraged to freely annotate or even rewrite
the lecture text into their own words, also inserting source code as
Babel blocks, doing git adds and commits locally, then when done, do a
pull request to the teacher&rsquo;s repo. Then the teacher would go through
the individual pull requests and together they would discuss
everyone&rsquo;s changes.

It might be hard to get all of what Charles Scalfani is saying
in his <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">IEEE Spectrum</a> article <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">Why Functional Programming Should Be the
Future of Software Development</a>, but one easy take-away is that
non-functional languages don&rsquo;t scale well due to lack of referential
transparency and too much state juggling. A typical blub-written
project without referential transparency must rely in extensive
testing and debugging &#x2014; which can&rsquo;t always find all the worst-case
scenarios.

We&rsquo;ll learn plenty about discrete math as we go. But for a
quick introduction, consider a light switch that goes on or
off. That&rsquo;s two <i>discrete</i> states. The opposite of discrete would be
<i>continuous</i>. So think of a volume control knob on your radio,
<i>continuous</i> in that it <i>continually</i> changes, i.e., the change is so
small and incremental that they seem to blend together into one
<i>continuous</i> sweep from soft to loud.

Imagine wanting to study math in college after having seen
absolutely <i>no</i> math K-12. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>

attempts to expose kids to a discrete math, if not a computer algorithm
way of seeing math. But in our humble opinion it&rsquo;s far too little.

You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of <i>algorithms</i>. Very simply put, an
algorithm is a set of instructions, perhaps like a baking recipe, that
produces a mathematical cake. In computational math, we&rsquo;re basically
redoing, reimagining math formulae as algorithms which then can run on
computers. Lots and lots more about algorithms as we move along.

If anyone is bothered about why we&rsquo;re not being more woke/PC,
hey, we&rsquo;re just being realistic. After all, who in the U.S. would be

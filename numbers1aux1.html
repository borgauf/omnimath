<p>
In this Auxiliary we&rsquo;ll wend our way into <i>induction</i> by way of
looking at sequences and recursion. Induction is a very important
concept seen all over higher math and computer science. Induction
seems odd at first glance. It seems to be saying, &ldquo;We know this case
is true, so we&rsquo;ll say the very next case is true also. And then we&rsquo;ll
just continue doing this until&#x2026;&rdquo; Right. So we&rsquo;ll take apart and see
why it actually works.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org625aed0">
<p>
It&rsquo;s Tuesday afternoon and the siblings meet in their usual study room
at the library to go over their honors computer science course
assignments. Yesterday, Professor Chandra gave the first of the week&rsquo;s
three lectures where she introduced the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical
induction</a>. She had made the upcoming week&rsquo;s lecture notes and a
homework assignment available at the class&rsquo; GitHub repository last
Friday. The von der Surwitzs are going over their own initial
annotations to the lecture notes, as well as comparing their
assignment code so far&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But before we join their discussion, we&rsquo;ll first start out with a key
piece of math logic behind the whole idea of induction starting with
<i>modus ponens</i>. The von der Surwitzes got most of this material in
Monday&rsquo;s lecture, and reading on in the notes, they&rsquo;re now ready to
discuss it&#x2026;

or the <i>law of detachment</i> that says
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we start with a <i>conditional premise</i>, e.g., <i>if \(R\), then \(B\)</i>, or,
<i>\(R\) implies \(B\)</i>, (\(R \supset B\;\))<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
also written as \(R \implies B\;\). Both \(\supset\) and \(\implies\) are
used to mean <i>implies</i>.
</span> and we consider it to be true,
then</li>
<li>we consider the <i>antecedent</i> (first half) of the conditional premise
\(R \supset B\;\), i.e., \(R\) as a stand-alone premise that is also true,</li>
<li><i>therefore</i>, we logically conclude the <i>consequent</i> of the
initial conditional premise, \(B\), is true as a stand-alone too.</li>
</ul>

<p>
e.g.,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>If</i> you are \(R\!\) eading this, <i>then</i> you must be \(B\!\) right (\(R \supset B\;\;\))</li>
<li>Yes, you are \(R\!\) eading this, (\(R\)).</li>

\(\therefore\;\) is the LaTeX symbol for <i>therefore</i>.
</span>, you must be \(B\!\) right (\(\therefore B\;\)).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This can also be written as \(((R \implies B) \land R) \implies
B\;\;\;\). Spoken,
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
R <b>implies</b> B, <b>and</b> R is true, <b>implies</b> (therefore) B is true.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Modus ponens is called the law of detachment because after asserting
that both the conditional premise and its <i>antecedent</i> are true we
then <i>detach</i> the <i>consequent</i> from the conditional premise as a
stand-alone truth in and of itself<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
A good study technique is to read the theoretical explanation,
then some examples, then go back to the theoretical explanation to see
how it is the perfect generalization of all the examples.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Modus ponens is a <i>rule of inference</i> that says anytime we can assert
the truth of the two premises, namely, \(R \supset B\;\) as well as \(R\;\), we
can assert the truth of the conclusion \(B\;\).

<p>
⌜ If we have a bag of marbles, and each marble seems to be a different
color, and we empty them out on the floor in a straight line, could we
make any sense out of their order? Using our imagination, sure, why
not? For just that first pouring-out we could make up any story we
wanted about the order we see. But we would only have to dump out the
marbles one more time to see our imaginings were false. Why? Because
they would invariably come out in a different order. And if we
repeated this dumping out over and over we would see only random
order, that is, no rhyme or reason to how they&rsquo;re lining up from one
dump to the next.
</p>

<p>
But let&rsquo;s say we have &ldquo;magic&rdquo; marbles that do in fact come out of the
bag in a certain order. Yes, it might be interesting to know why they
have this self-ordering thing going on. Is there some machine in the
bag that&rsquo;s sending them out in a particular order? So this week we&rsquo;re
going to look at something deeper with order. What if creating a
sequence were based on a formula or algorithm, and not just some
built-in ordering principle that we give it with a Haskell <code>Ord</code>
instance? What if we could <i>create</i> an ordered sequence by applying a
formula?
</p>

<p>
Now, we know about sequences from Haskell lists, and in math a
sequence is defined as <font color = "#650d1c">an enumerated
collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order
matters</font> &#x2026; that&rsquo;s a quote from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">Wikipedia page on
sequences</a>. And no, let&rsquo;s not confuse sequences and series. In math
they&rsquo;re not interchangeable. A series in math is a <i>summation</i> of an
infinitely many quantities to some starting quantity. We&rsquo;ll see more
of them later. So going forth, we&rsquo;re going to see how sequences can be
created. One way is through recurrence relationships, where one
element is built from the previous element. We&rsquo;ll take a look at some
things you saw in basic algebra but probably didn&rsquo;t realize were about
sequences and recurrence. ⌟

At first glance, the first homework problem seems trivial to the von
der Surwitzes
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">⇲ How high would you be if you
climbed a certain number of steps, e.g., \(127\:\), up a set of stairs
on a hill, given the starting altitude \(A = 800\:\) feet at the bottom
of the stairs, and each step has height \(B = 8\:\) inches?  Write a
Haskell function that takes in the number of steps as the single input
parameter, incorporates already knows \(A\) and \(B\:\), and gives the
answer in feet.</font>
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> The steps are all the same so their order doesn&rsquo;t really
matter. That&rsquo;s obvious. <br />
<font color = "#111" size = 5%>𝔘𝔴𝔢:</font> Right, and we just enumerate them with the natural
numbers. Gosh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get &ldquo;enumerate with natural
numbers&rdquo; out of my head again.<br />
[Laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So we don&rsquo;t need to take the \(127\) and do anything with
it. Did you see that next problem? It&rsquo;s just an algebra problem, but
still&#x2026;<br />
[Rueful murmurs of agreement.] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [Gestures with hands.] So without overthinking this, it&rsquo;s just
saying that you need to multiply \(127\:\), or whatever steps you give
it, by \(8\) inches. That&rsquo;s not very hard. And then you convert it to
feet and then add that to the altitude. I guess this is mainly to get
us to use Haskell&rsquo;s <code>let</code><label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<b>Uwe, Ursula</b>: Yeah.

<p>
Ursula had plugged her laptop into the big monitor on the wall. She
pulled up her homework

<pre class="example">
884.6666666666666

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So like the professor said, the take-away here is that when we
declare variables like <code>stepinches</code> and <code>basealt</code> inside the <code>let</code> and
<code>in</code>, they&rsquo;re visible only inside that <code>let...in</code> structure and never
outside them. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> And then she asks if we can rewrite it with <i>another</i>
<code>let...in</code> inside the first one, right? And the stuff inside the
nested <code>let...in</code> can&rsquo;t be seen by the outside, but the outside
<code>let...in</code> can be seen by the inside.

And so they did another version of <code>stepsAltCalc</code>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> And then we still need to tame those decimal places. What do
you think?
</p>

<p>
They then followed the professor&rsquo;s link to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18723381/rounding-to-specific-number-of-digits-in-haskell">stackoverflow question</a>,
as well as an <a href="https://typeclasses.com/featured/rounding">article on rounding in Haskell</a>. They studied them for a
while, then traded glances.
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Sometimes I can&rsquo;t tell if Professor Chandra is, yeah,

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Why? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Well, do you remember she&rsquo;s talking about rounding, but then
she&rsquo;s off on this tangent about how [writing on the board] \(2/2\)
should also be seen as \(2\) times the inverse of \(2\:\)? And then she&rsquo;s
talking about how &ldquo;literal&rdquo; numbers, like <code>51</code>, is actually
<code>fromIntegral 51</code> to the system. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> And [paging through her written notes] right, <code>3.14</code> is
actually, ahh, here it is: <code>fromRational 3.14</code> internally.

<p>
Ursula then typed this in at the REPL

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [reading her notes] Well, for one it means you&rsquo;re not really

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So the naked literal numbers are part of the type class system,

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [going to the board and writing ] So as the professor explained
it, you always start at the inner-most operation. That would the

type <code>Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So we can assume that <code>f</code> becomes a <code>Double</code> because they have

All right, so this first part goes over how to set up an alternative
version of the natural numbers. You might want to pull up file,
Ursula, and code this in [writing on the board] <code>data Nat = Zero |

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [typing] Got
it. Evaluating.

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> She didn&rsquo;t go over
this in class, right? <br />

<p>
Then they went on in the lecture notes
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Okay, next. Here&rsquo;s the pictures of the strange broccoli and the
sunflower head she showed us in class. There&rsquo;s supposed to be a
pattern and she wanted us to think about it. Without looking ahead in
the notes. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I had no idea where to go on that one. Anyone have any luck?
<br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Maybe. I looked it up and it&rsquo;s got something to do with what
they call the <i>Fibonacci sequence</i>. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard of it, but that&rsquo;s about all. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I just quickly looked at it, but basically it&rsquo;s a sequence of
numbers that you can build according to a rule, a formula. [He got up
and went to the whiteboard and started to write.] So you start the
sequence with \(\{0,1\}\;\), then to get a new sequence element, you
just add the last two numbers of the sequence you already have. So if
you started with \(\{0,1\}\;\) then \(0\) plus \(1\) is \(1\;\). Now you&rsquo;ve
got \(\{0,1,1\}\;\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So then to get then next number you add the last two numbers
\(1\) and \(1\), you get \(2\;\) and now the sequence is
\(\{0,1,1,2\}\;\). Then do it again and get \(\{0,1,1,2,3\}\;\). Again,
the last two to get \(\{0,1,1,2,3,5\}\;\). You can do this and make the
sequence as long as you like. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Right. So instead of the sixty-first step being, er, step
\(127\;\), the the sixty-first Fibonacci number will have to be figured
out by a formula that does some sort of calculation.  <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Maybe. I&rsquo;m not totally sure about that. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Anyway, a number in the sequence depends on the numbers before
it. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Well, I did look at the Wikipedia page&#x2026; <br />
</p>

<p>
They then took a look on the monitor at the Wikipedia article called
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci number</a></i>, but when they got to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Definition">definition</a>, they got
stuck
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation
</p>

\begin{align*}
F_{n} &= 0, F_{1} = 1 \\[.5em]
F_{n} &= F_{n-1}  + F_{n-2} \quad \text{for} \;\; n > 1
\end{align*}

</blockquote></div>

<p>
They decided that this was some new sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise">piecewise function</a>,
although they weren&rsquo;t sure. They followed the link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">recurrence

definition. However, they skipped on to the examples and found the
formula for <i>factorial</i>
</p>

\begin{align*}
0! &= 1\;, \\[.5em]
n! &= n(n-1)! \quad \text{for}\;\; n> 0
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [getting up and writing on the whiteboard] Okay, remember the
definition of the absolute value function? [continuing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
|x| =
\begin{cases}
x,  & \text{if $x \ge 0$} \\[.5em]
-x, & \text{if $x \lt 0$}

<p>
This is two-part just like factorial is is all I&rsquo;m saying. <br />
<b>Uwe, Ursula</b>: [murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So the \(0! = 1\) is
just your &ldquo;starter&rdquo; case, your <i>base case</i>, you get that one for
free. But after that &#x2014; and that&rsquo;s where it gets into defining
something based on itself. A bit confusing. <br />
[murmurs of agreement then silence as the buddies digested the
formula] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Well, when in
doubt, <i>plug something in</i>. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [writing on the
board] So let&rsquo;s start with \(1\), and that&rsquo;s \(1!  = 1(1-1)!\:\), which is
just \(1(0)!\:\) [pausing] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [jumping in] That
has to be \(1\) <i>times</i> \(0\) factorial, not \(1\) times \(0\) first, <i>then</i>
factorial that. Otherwise we would never get anywhere. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Sure, so the \(0\)
factorial we know to be \(1\) and \(1\) times \(1\) is \(1\). So \(1!\) is
\(1\). So let&rsquo;s try it for \(2\). [writing]
</p>

\begin{align*}
2! &= 2(2-1)!
&= 2(1)!
&= 2(1)
&= 2
\end{align*}




<p>
Much simpler
would be your feet and legs going up a flight of steps, each step the
same as the last, except that it&rsquo;s higher and more forward than the
last. With the certainty of one step being a given amount up and over
the other we would be able to, e.g., calculate our altitude given how
many steps we had climbed.
</p>

<p>
Anytime we have a sequence of things following a certain regular
pattern from one to the next, this &ldquo;one to the next&rdquo; phenomenon can be
leveraged. This means we may figure out a &ldquo;solution,&rdquo; in that we
create a formula to compute <i>any</i> element in the sequence.

By the way, why is the result of <code>fac</code> with input <code>0</code> set to
<code>1</code>? In math, a product of no factors is considered to be the
<i>multiplicative identity</i>, i.e., that number when multiplied by any
number gives that number back. <code>1</code> times something is just that
something again.
</span>. Again, this
is a building process. That is to say recursive <code>fac</code> is not an
algorithm, per se, a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; for drilling directly into any place
in a sequence. What would a solution look like for going straight to a
place in a sequence?

Another version of factorial would be simply <code>fac n = product

brave, look under the hood <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/src/GHC.List.html#product">here</a>. What you&rsquo;re seeing is a special

about <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Foldr_Foldl_Foldl'">here</a>. So <code>product</code> is based on a more basic concept of a

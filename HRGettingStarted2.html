The von der Surwitzes pop over to the student center cafe for a break.
They grab a large mineral water, a brand they knew in Germany, and Ute

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> All right, so I
emailed the professor about a couple of questions from that first
chapter of <i>The Haskell Road</i>, and she replied saying, first, she&rsquo;s
happy we&rsquo;re tackling the material early. And she mentioned some
resources &#x2014; a collection of texts she has on reserve at the
library. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Sort of like, I&rsquo;m
not going to give you the answers. I&rsquo;m going to point you in the right
direction.  <br />
[murmurs of acknowledgement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> What books are
they? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Math. Upper level
college texts. Abstract algebra and number theory, mainly. <br />
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I getting the
general impression that computer science has all these higher math
concepts, but then you don&rsquo;t go as far as a math major does. <br />
[silence, eating and drinking] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [continuing] I
guess you&rsquo;re just supposed to learn as much as you can. But like she
said at the open house, computer science is a lot of <i>applied</i>
mathematics. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> And the math is
the hardest part for incoming CS students, those first four
semesters. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re emphasizing the math in this
course. <br />
[nods of agreement then silence as they eat and drink] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
Not so much hand-waving. And she doesn&rsquo;t have set in stone what she
wants us to get through. The course is open-ended. Wow, I just find
that amazing. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> But I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll
need to keep moving and not be laggards about it. We&rsquo;re high
schoolers, true, but this is like a super-AP course that&rsquo;s exclusively
college-level material.<br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> And that&rsquo;s because
so much of the first year or so of a college comp-sci curriculum
really could and should be taught at the high school level. That&rsquo;s her
theory &#x2014; and we&rsquo;re her <i>Versuchskaninchen</i><label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> A <i>whole</i> year,
the <i>whole</i> school year. Her sabbatical ends next summer, but I&rsquo;m
pretty sure I&rsquo;ll want to continue. I don&rsquo;t know if I want to be a
computer scientist or software engineer, but learning this can&rsquo;t
hurt. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> I guess you could
say Novalis is sort of an open <i>Gynmasium</i>. <br />
[soft laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> And what happens
afterward? They definitely want you to just keep going at the U. Which
I wouldn&rsquo;t mind at all. <br />
[looks about the table] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Yes, and lots of
people just drift into a half-and-half situation where there taking
courses over at the U. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Well, Father

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd110d0">
<p>
Back at the library study room they&rsquo;ve checked out the reserved books
and are looking through sections of those that deal with the basic
theory of division.
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [reading from the
Divisibility section of <i>Proofs, A Long-Form Mathematical
Textbook</i><label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<i><a href="https://longformmath.com/proofs-home">Proofs; A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook</a></i> by Jay Cummings
</span>] All right, so Professor Chandra wants us to
understand divisibility before we go to <i>greatest common divisor</i>, and
before we talk about primes. She said, You have to know all of the
implications of &ldquo;divided by&rdquo; before you can advance. And like it&rsquo;s
saying in here, [reading] you could just say, \(a\) divides \(b\) if
\(\frac{a}{b}\) produces an integer. <br />
[Ursula and Uwe read the section from a second copy] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] But
we don&rsquo;t want that definition, we want <i>this</i> definition [writing on
the board]
</p>

\begin{align}
\exists \: k \in \mathbb{Z},\; a \neq 0, \;\;a \mid b \;\; \text{if} \;\; b = a \cdot k  
\end{align}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] The
symbol \(a \mid b\:\) means \(a\) divides \(b\) for some \(k\) where \(b = a \cdot
k\;\) and \(a\) is not equal to zero. [pausing] Right, all that makes
sense. So basically, this turns the whole question of divisibility
into finding a proper integer value for \(k\:\) to <i>multiply</i> with. Now
we have a mathy formalist way of seeing divisibility. <br />
[murmurs of approval] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I like how he says
good definitions don&rsquo;t just fall out of the sky. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Then the
examples, like \(2 \mid 14\) is true because \(14 = 2 \cdot 7\:\), in other
words we&rsquo;ve found a whole number integer, \(k = 7\), and we&rsquo;re happy. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Again, we&rsquo;ve
turned division into an issue of true-false logic and
multiplication. [writing on the board] So \(7 \mid 23\) doesn&rsquo;t work
because we have no solution for \(7 \cdot k = 23\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> And look at that
last one where it&rsquo;s \(a \mid 0\;\). That&rsquo;s true, for a non-zero \(a\)
since we can say \(0 = a \cdot 0\) is always true for any \(a\) as long as \(k
= 0\;\). <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So for [writing
on the board] \(a \mid b\), we can say \(a\) is a <i>divisor</i> of \(b\), and
\(b\) is a <i>multiple</i> of \(a\), and \(b\) is <i>divisible</i> by \(a\). <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So they want us to
understand that we&rsquo;re not supposed to see \(2 \mid 14\) and just say it
<i>equals</i> \(7\). It&rsquo;s not supposed to be seen as a calculation, it&rsquo;s a
logic <i>expression</i> that&rsquo;s true or false &#x2014; for some value \(k\:\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Right. We&rsquo;re in
the world of logic now, not grade school arithmetic. So everything has
to be reexplained and reworked. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> All right, so in
this book<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
A <i>Computational Introduction To Number Theory and Algebra</i> by
Victor Shoup; <a href="&amp;shoup2009computational">&amp;shoup2009computational</a>.
}
</span> they have a theorem about divisibility. [writing on
the board]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(a \mid a\), \(1 \mid a\), and \(a \mid 0\);</li>
<li>\(0 \mid a \iff a = 0\);</li>
<li>\(a \mid b \iff -a \mid b \iff a \mid -b\);</li>
<li>\(a \mid b \land a \mid c \implies a \mid (b + c)\);</li>
<li>\(a \mid b \land b \mid c \implies a \mid c\)</li>
</ol>





<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Good, now he&rsquo;s
talking about the <i>transitive</i> property of divisibility. It is a
<i>proposition</i>, which is a type of theorem, and that means it comes
with a proof. [writing on the board] Here it is in the compact math
logic form
</p>

\begin{align*}
a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z},\;\; a \mid b \;\land\; b \mid c \implies a \mid c
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] And
then he goes on to prove it by saying assume the <i>if</i> part, the \(a
\mid b \;\land\; b \mid c\:\) part is true, that means the <i>then</i> part, the
\(a \mid c\) part is true. So [writing]
</p>

\begin{align*}
b &= a \cdot s \\[.4em]
c &= b \cdot t
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] for
some integers \(s\) and \(t\;\). And now [writing]
</p>

\begin{align*}
c &= b \cdot t \\[.4em]
&= (a \cdot s) \cdot t   \\[.4em]
&= a \cdot (s \cdot t) \quad\quad \ldots \; \text{associativity}
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] So
since we have the form \(c = a \cdot (s \cdot t)\) where we assumed \(s\) and \(t\)
are integers, and that&rsquo;s the basic form of divisibility, so yes, \(a
\mid c\) since we&rsquo;ve shown \(c = a \cdot k\) where \(k = (s \cdot t)\:\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Good. Let&rsquo;s
switch over to this other book [she picks up a Springer Verlag
book<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<i><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Whole_Truth_About_Whole_Numbers/ahUGswEACAAJ?hl=en">The Whole Truth About Whole Numbers</a></i> by Sylvia Forman and
Agnes M. Rash;
</span> and pages through it] Ah, in this book there&rsquo;s a section
called <i>Divisors and the Greatest Common Divisor</i>. [paging to section,
reading] Oh, here&rsquo;s one, <i>Determine whether true or false</i> [writing on
the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
2 \mid (6n + 4)
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Interesting. So
writing it in the divisibility way [gets up and writes on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
(6n + 4) = 2k
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So before we freak
out and get lost, let&rsquo;s just notice that [writing]
</p>

\begin{align}
2(3n + 4) &= 2k \\[.4em]
3n + 4 &= k
\end{align}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [continuing] I&rsquo;d
say we don&rsquo;t need to go any further with this. \(2 \mid (6n + 4)\) is
true &#x2014; which means it&rsquo;s got solutions &#x2014; because \(2\) will go into
\((6n + 4)\) for whatever \(n\) wants to be. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> And this whole
formal divisibility thing helps because if you just saw this one day
[writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align}
\frac{(6n + 4)}{2} = 3n + 2 
\end{align}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing]
you&rsquo;ve now got a second way to see the idea that the equation is true
for any \(n\), that it&rsquo;s dependent on \(n\;\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [looking
ironically] Thanks, Uwe, Ute, for keeping it real. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [reading text] All
right, we have this example [writing on board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
0 \mid 11
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] which
is false because there can&rsquo;t be any \(k\) where \(k \cdot 0\) equals
\(11\;\). Agreed? <br />
[nods of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] All
right, how about this?
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Prove that if \(\,a \mid b\) then \(-\, a \mid b\)
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Let&rsquo;s just
logic it out [getting up and writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
b & = a \cdot k \\[.4em]
b &= (-a) \cdot (-k) \\[.4em]
b &= - (a) \cdot (k) \\[.4em]
b &= - a \cdot k 
\end{align*}

<p>
then
</p>

\begin{align*}
- a \mid b  \quad \text{for some}\; k \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So
\(k\) by virtue of being an integer, which can be either positive or
negative, we&rsquo;ve derived \(-\, a \mid b\) from \(a \mid b\;\). <br />
[silence while the others study the board] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Hold it. I&rsquo;m not
sure we&rsquo;ve got the spirit of this, quite. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> How so? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [going to the
board] We need to make sure we understand this as [writing] \((-a) \mid
b\;\) and not as \(-(a \mid b)\:\), right? <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So that means
we&rsquo;ve got [writing] \(b = (-a)(-k)\) as the only possible solution to
keep that \(b\) positive. And I don&rsquo;t think you meant to factor out
\(-1\:\) like you did. So \(k\) must be negative to go with the \(-a\:\),
which then gives positive \(b\;\). That&rsquo;s what is meant, I think. Yes,
\(k\) being an integer allows this. But again, we&rsquo;re dealing with a
multiplicative relationship, we&rsquo;re not doing division. And I&rsquo;m sure
we&rsquo;ll find out why this is so important in a while. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Oh, I think
that was in here. [pulling a large-format book from her messenger
bag<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span> and pages to tabbed page]. Right, and he shows that \(0 \mid
0\:\), that zero divides zero, is true &#x2014; because [writing on board]
\(0 = 0 \cdot k\:\), meaning \(k\) can be anything and the expression remains
true. [reading further] And he&rsquo;s calling \(k\) the <i>accessory
number</i>. [reading further] So his wording is the integers \(x\) that
satisfy \(7 \mid x\) are \(x = 7 \cdot k\) &#x2014; and that will be the arithmetic
progression of the multiples of \(7\:\). They&rsquo;re evenly
spaced. Good. And there&rsquo;s this [going to the board and writing] <br />
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Plot the integers \(x\) which satisfy \(5 \mid (x - 2)\)
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [going to the
board and writing] So if that&rsquo;s to be true then we&rsquo;ve got \(x - 2 =
5k\:\), and that means for the multiples of \(5\:\), the <i>set</i> of
integers \(x\) must keep \(x - 2\) multiples of \(5\) also. So for example
</p>

\begin{align*}
-3 - 2 &= 5 \cdot -1 \\[.4em]
2 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 0 \\[.4em]
7 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 1 \\[.4em]
12 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 2 \\[.4em]
\ldots
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] And
the so-called <i>geometric</i> view of this set of \(x\)&rsquo;s would be a number
line with points [drawing on the board]

is to say, \(x\) is two more than a multiple of \(5\:\). <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Okay, next one
[writing on the board]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>

Plot the integers \(x\) which satisfy \(x \mid 12\:\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing
writing] So that means \(12 = x \cdot k\) where \(k\) will just be the
integers. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Again, I would say
we shouldn&rsquo;t read too much into this. The basic fact is [going to the
board and writing] we have the set of integers that divide \(12\)
</p>

\begin{align}
[-1,-2,-3,-4,6,-12,1,2,3,4,6,12]
\end{align}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> And however that
works out with \(x \cdot k\) is incidental, since whatever \(x\) and \(k\) need
to be, their product has to be in this [point at (5)] set.<br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I&rsquo;ll draw that
quickly [drawing number line]

<span class="cap">Divisors of 12 on an integer line</span>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> All right,
Weissman deals with <i>transitive</i> again. But before that he talks about
<i>reflexive</i> and <i>antisymmetric</i> in relation to divisibility. [writing

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>

<p>
[smiles of ironic mute astonishment] <br />

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So
this is showing us the <i>reflexivity of divisibility</i> \(\mid\:\). Then he
says in the margin, <i>Every integer is a multiple of itself</i>. And then
he has [writing on board] \(x = x \cdot 1\) <br />
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [reading from her

[murmurs of agreement] <br />

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So if that
\((a,a)\) is seen as just a coordinate pair on a regular Cartesian
coordinate plane, [drawing a graph on the board] then yes, it&rsquo;s just
points on the diagonal

<p>
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So without getting
too lost in the details, reflexive means things are related somehow to
themselves. So equality would work, even <i>greater than or equal</i>, and
<i>less than or equal</i> since the equal part is true. So for example, all
integers are greater than <i>or</i> equal to themselves. [gives ironic
look] Well, it&rsquo;s true. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Antisymmetric is next? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Right. And I&rsquo;d
like to understand what <i>symmetric</i> means first &#x2014; just to get <i>very</i>
confused. <br />
[laughter, then all searching on their laptops] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Again, we&rsquo;re
looking for <i>symmetric relation</i>. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Okay, Wikipedia
says a <i>symmetric relation</i> is basically, as I paraphrase it, a
situation where if \(a = b\) is true, then \(b = a\) is also true [writing
on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
\forall a,b \in X, \;\; aRb \iff bRa
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] And
the \(aRb\) means \(a\) and \(b\) are in a relationship. And then examples
might be we&rsquo;re in symmetric relationships with each other because
we&rsquo;re all blood siblings to each other. So you Ursula are my sibling,
and I am your sibling. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Right, but
blood sibling is <i>not</i> reflexive, it&rsquo;s <i>irreflexive</i> because you can&rsquo;t
be called a sibling of yourself. But then a number can be a multiple
of itself &#x2014; \(1\) times itself &#x2014; and we established that as
reflexive; but I&rsquo;m not my own sibling. <br />
[murmurs of agreement]. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So in a round
robin binary way, we share the same parents. That&rsquo;s symmetric, but
it&rsquo;s not reflexive, is it? You can&rsquo;t share a parent with yourself, can
you? <br />
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> If it were
worded <i>my mother is my mother</i> or <i>my father is my father</i>, it&rsquo;s the
same as saying <i>\(a\) is equal to \(a\)</i>, isn&rsquo;t it? So the wording &ldquo;parent
in common with myself&rdquo; is misleading, because we&rsquo;re not relating me
and my parent directly, we&rsquo;re relating the parent to that same parent
by means of me as the joiner. Does that make sense? It&rsquo;s in the basic
spirit of a binary relation that relates an element to itself. <br />
[half-hearted murmurs of agreement and ironic smirking] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> And then we&rsquo;ve
said the equals relation is reflexive <i>and</i> symmetric, right? Do we
want to say this, really? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Sure, why not?
You know, so often I learn the &ldquo;official&rdquo; way, the accepted answer &#x2014;
and then I talk myself into believing it. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Are we ready to
tackle <i>antisymmetry</i>? <br />
[eager murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Okay, I&rsquo;ve
searched on <i>antisymmetry</i> and gone to a Wolfram MathWorld page<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AntisymmetricRelation.html">Antisymmetric Relation</a>.
</span>
that says [reading]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
A relation \(R\) on a set \(S\) is antisymmetric provided that distinct
elements are never both related to one another. In other words \(xRy\)
and \(yRx\) together imply that \(x = y\:\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] And
then from the Wikipedia article [going to the board and writing]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
If \(aRb\) with \(a \ne b\) then \(bRa\) must not hold.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Good. So now
Weissman says [writing on the board]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
For integers \(x\), \(y\), if \(x \mid y\) and \(y \mid x\), then \(x = \pm y\:\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
And then he shows it by saying [writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
\text{if}\;\;y &= mx \quad \text{and} \\[.5em]
x &= ny \quad \text {for some integers}\;\; x, y
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
And then we can say [writing]
</p>

\begin{align}
x = ny = n(mx) = (nm)x
\end{align}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
And now if we say \(x \ne 0\) we can divide this [pointing to (6)] by
\(x\:\) [writing on board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{x} &= \frac{ny}{x} = \frac{n(mx)}{x} = \frac{(nm)x}{x} \\[.5em]
1 &= \frac{ny}{x} = nm = nm
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So
multiplying by a number is the same as dividing by its reciprocal &#x2014;
and vice versa. And now we have a reciprocal relationship between \(n\)
and \(m\) since two numbers multiplied equaling \(1\) means they must be
reciprocals of each other [writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
1 &= nm \\[.5em]
\frac{1}{m} &= n \\[.5em]
\frac{1}{n} &= m
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing,
writing on the board] But as he&rsquo;s saying, \(\frac{1}{m}\) and
\(\frac{1}{n}\) cannot be anything but \(1\) and still be integers, so
it&rsquo;s proven that \(n = m = \pm1\:\) So subbing into [points to (6)]
</p>

\begin{align*}
x &= ny \\[.5em]
x &= (\pm1)y
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Which is, again,
showing us that division is not ever going to be symmetric unless
we&rsquo;re just talking about an integer dividing itself, basically &#x2014;
that is, plus or minus itself. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [looking at the
Weissman text] So then he does <i>transitivity</i> with divisibility, and
it&rsquo;s the same as we did before. Then he does [writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
d,x,y \in \mathbb{Z}\; \land\; d \mid x \implies d \mid xy 
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> There&rsquo;s his
proof, that is [writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
x &= md \\[.5em]
xy &= (md)y \quad \text{(multiply both sides by $y$)} \\[.5em]
xy &= (my)d
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So \(xy\) is a
multiple of \(d\), that multiple being \((my)\). Okay? <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Next, is this
one [writing on the board]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
If \(d \mid x\) and \(d \mid y\), then \(d \mid (x + y)\) and  \(d \mid (x - y)\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
And the proof is we can say [writing on board] for \(x = md\) and \(y =
nd\) for integers \(m\) and \(n\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
x \pm y = (md) \pm (nd) = (m \pm n)d
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
And this shows that \(x \pm y\) is a multiple of \(d\). [reading further in
the Weissman text] Then he gives a variation on this idea, which he
calls the <i>two out of three principle for divisibility</i>. [writing on
the board]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Let \(a\),\(b\),\(c\) be integers satisfying the equation \(a + b = c\). Let
\(d\) bye an integer. If two of the set \(\{a,b,c\}\) are multiples of
\(d\), then the third number must also be a multiple of \(d\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> This is just the
previous one reworded, right? The basic situation [writing on the
board] \(a + b = c\) can be rearranged into \(a = c - b\) or \(b = c -
a\). So whichever two you have as multiples of \(d\), we add or subtract
them to get the third, and that&rsquo;s covered by \(d \mid (x \pm y)\). <br />
[soft murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> This
demonstrates two-out-of-three [reading from
the text and copying on the board]
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Demonstrate that \(2\,999\,997\) is a multiple of \(3\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Okay, my
turn. [going to the board and writing] Since \(3\,000\,000 - 3 =

3 &\mid 3 \quad &\text{(second known)} \\[.5em]
\therefore \;\; 3 &\mid (3\,000\,000 - 3)
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Exactly. We knew
two were divisible by \(d\), so those two added or subtracted from one
another we could know as well. Good. <br />
[murmurs of satisfaction] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Hey, we&rsquo;re really
going down this rabbit hole. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [perusing
Weissman] It&rsquo;s only one, no, two more exercises, then it goes on to
something else. Let&rsquo;s do this next one and go back to Cummings. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> No matter what,
I&rsquo;ll never see division the same again. <br />
[laughter] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Hey, I just
searched on <code>haskell divisibility</code> and a stackoverflow came
up<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3990095/testing-divisibility-of-ints-by-11">Testing divisibility of Ints by 11</a>.
</span>. It basically asks whether an integer is divisible by
\(11\). And then it has some trick about adding and subtracting the
digits of the number, right. But then somebody gives the answer
[writing on the board]
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-haskell-definition">divisibleBy11</span> x <span class="org-haskell-operator">=</span> x <span class="org-haskell-operator">`rem`</span> 11 <span class="org-haskell-operator">==</span> 0

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I&rsquo;ll try it

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-haskell-definition">divisibleBy11</span> 33

<pre class="example">

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I assume that
<code>rem</code> means remainder, as in, Give me the remainder of a division. And
then that&rsquo;s checked if equal to \(0\). <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Again, we&rsquo;re
getting the true-false nature of divisibility. It&rsquo;s not just dividing
a number by another. It&rsquo;s asking yes or no whether a number properly
divides another. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Okay, here&rsquo;s
the next problem
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Find all integers \(x\) which satisfy \(x \mid (x + 6)\).
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [reading on]
Then he&rsquo;s solving it with his two out of three principle. So if we can
find two parts of this that are divisible, then the sum or difference
of these is then divisible as well. <br />
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> A hint is that
we&rsquo;re supposed to <i>assume</i> the \(x \mid (x + 6)\) is one of the
givens. Then we need another given. Then we add or subtract these two
givens to get the final formula. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Formula? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> In the last one we
had \(3\) divides one thing, and then \(3\) divides another thing,
therefore those two things \(3\) divides, when added or subtracted, also
are divisible by \(3\). So we could say the thing dividing is an unknown
variable \(x\). It divides, supposedly, \((x + 6)\), but then we need
another thing that \(x\) divides. <br />
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [writing on the
board] So, just pulling something out of thin air, if we assume the
second give is \(x \mid 7\), then we&rsquo;ve got something&#x2026;
</p>

\begin{align*}
x \mid (x + 6) - 7 = x \mid x - 1
\end{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> &#x2026;that doesn&rsquo;t
help us much. It&rsquo;s just a new &ldquo;what can \(x\) be&rdquo; question. That is,
we&rsquo;re going in circles. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Something tells me
we want to get rid of stuff on the right hand side of the
\(\mid\). Either get rid of the \(x\) or the \(6\). <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] So
why don&rsquo;t we assume &#x2014; oh, I know! Let&rsquo;s say \(x \mid x\) is the other
given since that&rsquo;s always true. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Good. [writing on

</p>

\begin{align*}
x &\mid x \quad \text{...second given after $x \mid (x + 6)$}\\[.5em]
x &\mid (x + 6) - x = 6 \quad \text{...subtracting one given from another}\\[.5em]
x &\mid 6
\end{align*}

<p>
[silence] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> What that&rsquo;s saying
&#x2014; as far as I can tell [writing on the board] \(x \mid (x + 6) \iff x
\mid 6\). Right? So whatever \(x\)&rsquo;s divide \(6\) will be our desired set

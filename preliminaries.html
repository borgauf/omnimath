that the length of this &ldquo;preliminaries&rdquo; list may be long, but you
should do what you can when you can. After all, this is open-ended,
with you as the timekeeper and the pacesetter. The goal is, again, to
climb the on-ramp to college-level comp-sci, e.g., computational
methods.

It&rsquo;s really important that we get familiar with the math of the
computer science world. Luckily, most of comp-sci math comes directly
from, builds on top of long-established abstract algebra, discrete
math, and math logic, i.e., there are plenty of good introductory
materials. Most of this is just getting familiar with the definitions
and terminology. We&rsquo;ll start with <i>set theory</i>, which is a must. Then
we&rsquo;ll learn about mathematical logic. Then we&rsquo;ll branch out into the
other areas of a typical comp-sci discrete mathematics curriculum.

<li>The <i>LibreTexts series</i> on <i><a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematical_Logic_and_Proof/Book%3A_Mathematical_Reasoning__Writing_and_Proof_(Sundstrom)">Mathematical Reasoning - Writing and
Proof</a></i> by Ted Sudstrom at Grand Valley State University is a good
starting point for us. Start <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematical_Logic_and_Proof/Book%3A_Mathematical_Reasoning__Writing_and_Proof_(Sundstrom)/05%3A_Set_Theory">here</a> with <i>Set Theory</i>, the concepts
of which we&rsquo;ll be diving into straightaway. Then go back and start
at the beginning with the chapter <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematical_Logic_and_Proof/Book%3A_Mathematical_Reasoning__Writing_and_Proof_(Sundstrom)/01%3A_Introduction_to_Writing_Proofs_in_Mathematics">Introduction to Writing Proofs in
Mathematics</a> and make as much progress as you can through the
book.
(<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>&#x2026;or try LibreTexts&rsquo; <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Combinatorics_and_Discrete_Mathematics/Applied_Discrete_Structures_(Doerr_and_Levasseur)/16%3A_An_Introduction_to_Rings_and_Fields/16.01%3A_Rings_Basic_Definitions_and_Concepts">Applied Discrete Structures</a> (Doerr and
Levasseur), which combines many comp-sci preliminaries very
well. Again, Haskell, probably more than any other language, is
based on this stuff. (<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Another great treatment of sets, etc. is from Oscar Levin&rsquo;s online
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html">Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</a>. Sudstrom,
Doerr/Levasseur, or this Levin treatment would be great to start
with. And as mentioned with the previous two, once done with sets,
go back and start at the beginning.  (<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>We need to learn mathematical logic, since logic is simply baked
into every programming language. Try <a href="https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MATH_220_Discrete_Math/2%3A_Logic">this LibreTexts series</a> on
logic to get more thorough than the previous rabbit hole. Pay
particular attention to the notation used on logic operators and
the terminology as well. This stuff comes up all the time in
programming. (<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Jessica Sklar is a math professor at Pacific Lutheran and her
online book <a href="https://sklarjk.github.io/fsaa/sets.html">First-Semester Abstract Algebra: A Structural Approach</a>
is meant for college math majors, but here we can get another view
of sets and then functions. Do something between a grok and a skim
for the first two chapters. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>These basic <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1/fp/lectures/2017/set-theory.pdf">set theory slides</a> with their tie-in to Haskell at the
end are very good as well. Do something between a grok and a
skim. We&rsquo;ll eventually be covering all the material therein.
(<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Browse through this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">Wikipedia Set article</a><label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Mathematics as experienced in Wikipedia&rsquo;s articles can be like
trying to drink from a full-blast fire hose; still, good can be
gleaned. And it&rsquo;s good to learn how to deal with the Wikipedia way of
handling math and CS.
</span>, paying special
attention to the Basic Operations section&#x2014;maybe even rabbit-hole
into the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)">union</a></i> article to understand some basic algebraic
operations on sets. You&rsquo;ve probably seen this stuff before with
<i>Venn diagrams;</i> this is some of the algebra behind the
diagrams. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Make sure you get comfortable with LaTeX math typesetting. What&rsquo;s
that you ask? Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Jp0lPj2-DQA">Trefor Bazett&rsquo;s excellent intro video</a>. After
that, have a look at the <i><a href="https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference">MathJax basic tutorial and quick
reference</a></i>. At this point you should open up Emacs, open up a test
org mode buffer and start experimenting. We&rsquo;ll concentrate on
MathJax since it</li>

We will start experimenting with Haskell in the first chapter
<i>Numbers</i>. Make sure you&rsquo;re getting along with the first rabbit hole,
<i>Learn you a Haskell&#x2026;</i>. Try to get through it ASAP. You can&rsquo;t know
Haskell enough. We include so many learning sources mainly because if
you didn&rsquo;t get something first try from one source, you can try it in
another source. But yes, LYAHFGG should be start-to-finish grokked.

<li><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> (LYAHFGG) is a widely-used,
often-suggested beginners site for starting out with Haskell. Work
through at least chapters 1 and 2 to understand a lot of what we&rsquo;ll
be doing with Haskell below<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Truthfully, this will be your go-to reference/tutorial for the
immediate CIMIC future. Get going with it and try to self-pace your
way through it all. It&rsquo;s not in-depth per se but will get you in the
Haskell ballpark, so to speak.
</span>. Pay particular attention to lists and
<i>list comprehensions</i>. (<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>A site haskell.org is suggesting is the UPenn course CIS194. We
suggest the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring15/">Spring 2015</a> version since it includes haskell source
files. This is a college course, but for beginners. Click on the
<i>Lectures &amp; Assignments</i> link at the top. (If you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://github.com/borgauf/omnimath">our github
repository</a> there&rsquo;s a directory containing all the Haskell files.)
(<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>An older but still go-to site recommended by many is the <i><a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">Real
World Haskell</a></i> site (also book). As the title suggests, it has a
more real-applications slant, and yes, the material can get into
heavy lifting, but one great advantage is it has prodigious
<i>comments</i> attached to ever web page section. So if you didn&rsquo;t
understand something, typically somebody has already explained it
in depth.</li>
<li>Book-wise, a nice, well-paced text would be <i><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell#:~:text=about%20the%20book,dive%20into%20custom%20Haskell%20modules.">Get Programming with
Haskell</a></i> by Will Kurt. Will bridges a lot of chasms between
beginner, intermediary, and advanced ideas. In other words, GPWH
gives plain-English explanations of things other treatments might go
deep into theory on. Really helpful, that. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Maybe try the Australian National University Haskell course
<a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/">COMP1100</a>. It came highly recommended.</li>
<li>Another big favorite for Haskell starters, but slightly more
challenging is <i><a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/haskell-98-tutorial.pdf">A Gentle Introduction to Haskell 98</a></i>. AGITH uses
more math terminology, which is what we&rsquo;re doing, but from the
shallow end first. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>You might take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension">Haskell Wiki article</a><label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The Haskell Wiki can be like trying to drink from a fire hose,
but good can be had for the brave and virtuous.
</span> too,
especially the examples, but don&rsquo;t expect to fully understand it yet. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Another big-league site to be aware of is the <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a>
site. Here you can search on hundreds of algorithms and numerical
analysis articles, each task done in the code of dozens of
programming languages<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Haskell">Category:Haskell</a>. 
</span>. Here you get to compare Haskell with
other languages. One thing you&rsquo;ll notice consistently is how much
shorter Haskell programs are than other languages. That&rsquo;s because
Haskell is very powerful and packs a large punch when solving
tasks. (<i>R<sub>FYI</sub>-hole</i>)</li>

* Monday at the library part 2

** Breaktime

The von der Surwitzes pop over to the student center cafe for a break.
They grab a large mineral water, a brand they knew in Germany, and Ute
has packed some /Vollkornbrot/ sandwiches of hummus and cucumber. They
sit at a table and pour the water and pass around out the sandwiches.

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ All right, so I
emailed the professor about a couple of questions from that first
chapter of /The Haskell Road/, and she replied saying, first, she's

** Divided by

:END:

Back at the library study room they've checked out the reserved books
and are looking through sections of those that deal with the basic
theory of division.

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [reading from the
Divisibility section of /Proofs, A Long-Form Mathematical
Textbook/[fn:1]] All right, so Professor Chandra wants us to
understand divisibility before we go to /greatest common divisor/, and
before we talk about primes. She said, You have to know all of the
implications of "divided by" before you can advance. And like it's
saying in here, [reading] you could just say, /$a$ divides $b$ if
$\frac{a}{b}$ is an integer/. \\
[Ursula and Uwe read the section from a second copy] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] But
we don't want that definition, we want /this/ definition [getting up
and writing on the board]

\begin{align}
\exists \: k \in \mathbb{Z},\; a \neq 0, \;\;a \mid b \;\; \text{if} \;\; b = a \cdot k  
\end{align}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] The
symbol $a \mid b\:$ means $a$ divides $b$ for some $k$ where $b = a \cdot
k\;$ and $a$ is not equal to zero. [pausing] Right, all that makes
sense. So basically, this turns the whole question of divisibility
into finding a proper integer value for $k\:$ to /multiply/ with . Now
we have a math-formalist way of seeing divisibility. \\
[murmurs of approval] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ I like how he says
good definitions don't just fall out of the sky. \\
[murmurs of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ Then the
examples, like $2 \mid 14$ is true because $14 = 2 \cdot 7\:$, in other
words we've found a whole number integer, $k = 7\:$ and we're
happy. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Again, we've
turned division into an issue of true-false logic and
multiplication. [writing on the board] So $7 \mid 23$ doesn't work
because we have no solution for $7k = 23\;$. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ And look at that
last one where it's $a \mid 0\;$. That's true, for a non-zero $a$
since we can say $0 = a \cdot 0$ is always true for any $a$ as long as $k
= 0\;$. \\
[murmurs of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ And like he says
we're not supposed to look at $2 \mid 14$ and just say it /equals/
$7\;$. It's not supposed to be seen as a calculation, it's a logic
/expression/ that is true or false --- for some value $k\:$. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Right. We're in
the world of logic now, not grade school arithmetic. So everything has
to be reexplained and reworked. \\
[murmurs of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Good, now he's
talking about the /transitive/ property of divisibility. It is a
/proposition/, which is a type of theorem, and that means it comes
with a proof. [writing on the board] Here it is in the compact math
logic form

\begin{align*}
a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z},\;\; a \mid b \;\land\; b \mid c \implies a \mid c
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] And
then he goes on to prove it by saying assume the /if/ part, the $a
\mid b \;\land\; b \mid c\:$ part is true, that means the /then/ part, the
$a \mid c$ part is true. So [writing]

\begin{align*}
b &= a \cdot s \\[.4em]
c &= b \cdot t
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] for
some integers $s$ and $t\;$. And now [writing]

\begin{align*}
c &= b \cdot t \\[.4em]
&= (a \cdot s) \cdot t   \\[.4em]
&= a \cdot (s \cdot t) \quad\quad \ldots \; \text{associativity}
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] So
since we have the form $c = a \cdot (s \cdot t)$ where we assumed $s$ and $t$
are integers, and that's the basic form of divisibility, so yes, $a
\mid c$ since we've shown $c = a \cdot k$ where $k = (s \cdot t)\:$. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ Good. Let's
switch over to this other book [she picks up a Springer Verlag
book[fn:2] and pages through it] Ah, in this book there's a section
called /Divisors and the Greatest Common Divisor/. [paging to section,
reading] Oh, here's one, /Determine whether true or false/ [writing on
the board]

\begin{align*}
2 \mid (6n + 4)
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Interesting. So
writing it in the divisibility way [gets up and writes on the board]

\begin{align*}
(6n + 4) = 2k
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ So before we freak
out and get lost, let's just notice that [writing]

\begin{align}
2(3n + 4) &= 2k \\[.4em]
3n + 4 &= k
\end{align}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] I'd
say we don't need to go any further with this. $2 \mid (6n + 4)$ is
true --- which means it's got solutions --- because $2$ will go into
$(6n + 4)$ for whatever $n$ wants to be. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ And this whole
formal divisibility thing helps because if you just saw this one day
[writing on the board]

\begin{align}
\frac{(6n + 4)}{2} = 3n + 2 
\end{align}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing]
you've now got a second way to see the idea that the equation is true
for any $n$, that it's dependent on $n\;$. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ [looking
ironically] Thanks, Uwe, Ute, for keeping it real. \\
[laughter] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [reading text] All
right, we have this example [writing on board]

\begin{align*}
0 \mid 11
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] which
is false because there can't be any $k$ where $k \cdot 0$ equals
$11\;$. Agreed? \\
[nods of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] All
right, how about this?

#+begin_quote
Prove that if $\,a \mid b$ then $-\, a \mid b$
#+end_quote

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ Let's just
logic it out [getting up and writing on the board]

\begin{align*}
b & = a \cdot k \\[.4em]
b &= (-a) \cdot (-k) \\[.4em]
b &= - (a) \cdot (k) \\[.4em]
b &= - a \cdot k

\begin{align*}
- a \mid b  \quad \text{for some}\; k \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] So
$k$ by virtue of being an integer, which can be either positive or
negative, we've derived $-\, a \mid b$ from $a \mid b\;$. \\
[silence while the others study the board] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Hold it. I'm not

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [going to the
board] We need to make sure we understand this as [writing] $(-a) \mid
b\;$ and not as $-(a \mid b)\:$, right? \\
[murmurs of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ So that means
we've got [writing] $b = (-a)(-k)$ as the only possible solution to
keep that $b$ positive. And I don't think you meant to factor out
$-1\:$ like you did. So $k$ must be negative to go with the $-a\:$,
which then gives positive $b\;$. That's what is meant, I think. Yes,
$k$ being an integer allows this. But again, we're dealing with a
multiplicative relationship, we're not doing division. And I'm sure
we'll find out why this is so important in a while. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ Oh, I think
that was in here. [pulling a large-format book from her messenger
bag[fn:3] and pages to tabbed page]. Right, and he shows that $0 \mid
0\:$, that zero divides zero, is true --- because [writing on board]
$0 = 0 \cdot k\:$, meaning $k$ can be anything and the expression remains
true. [reading further] And he's calling $k$ the /accessory
number/. [reading further] So his wording is the integers $x$ that
satisfy $7 \mid x$ are $x = 7 \cdot k$ --- and that will be the arithmetic
progression of the multiples of $7\:$. They're evenly
spaced. Good. And there's this [going to the board and writing] \\

#+begin_quote
Plot the integers $x$ which satisfy $5 \mid (x - 2)$
#+end_quote

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [going to the
board and writing] So if that's to be true then we've got $x - 2 =
5k\:$, and that means for the multiples of $5\:$, the /set/ of
integers $x$ must keep $x - 2$ multiples of $5$ also. So for example

\begin{align*}
-3 - 2 &= 5 \cdot -1 \\[.4em]
2 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 0 \\[.4em]
7 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 1 \\[.4em]
12 - 2 &= 5 \cdot 2 \\[.4em]
\ldots

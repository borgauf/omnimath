The von der Surwitzes are back at the student center cafe for a break.
This time just a pastry and a tea.

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ I have to say, I'm
very glad I'm approaching the whole post-calculus math world from this
perspective. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Are we in fact
post-calc?  [silence, mulling over question] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ Yes. We've
taken all our calc, Linear Algebra, Differential
Equations. We're where a German /Gymnasiast/ would be entering
a university. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Do you remember
what Professor Chandra said about that MIT professor who would turn
whatever math he wanted to remember into code[fn:1]? \\

/hog/ the professor. \\

really worked out, you, Ursula, racing ahead with the Haskell. And I
going ahead with the set theory, and you, Ute, going on ahead with the
math logic. I mean, we're definitely making progress. It's just that
we have so much to learn! \\

Back at the library study room they've checked out the reserved books
and are looking through sections of those that deal with the basic
theory of division.

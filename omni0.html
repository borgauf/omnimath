A key scene in the film <i><a href="https://youtu.be/v-pbGAts_Fg">Hidden Figures</a></i> has NASA&rsquo;s scientific team of
mathematicians, physicists, and engineers trying to figure out how to
get a space capsule orbiting around the Earth back on the ground. They
need to come up with the right math in order to transition the vehicle
from an elliptical orbit into a parabolic-shaped descent
path<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Technically speaking, a spacecraft orbiting the Earth is in an
<i>elliptic</i>, not circular orbit. And the path back to Earth after
breaking this orbit will resemble half of a parabola turned on its
side, hence, the adjective parabolic.
</span>. This is a rare moment in a Hollywood film where they
actually get the science right. There&rsquo;s no magic, no special effects,
no superheroes with magical powers, no cool grade-schooler who hacks
Pentagon computers in three seconds; instead, just a bunch of
ordinary-looking people with disparate backgrounds putting their heads
together to solve a tough problem. Why is this so special?  Because
during the process of finding the answer we see the math coming out of
books, out of heads, and being put to work on a real-world,
life-or-death problem. The icing on the cake is the depiction of the
team getting their just-delivered IBM mainframe computer (that no one
knows how to run) to help them. The bottom line takeaway: In the world
of STEM you&rsquo;re never far from the front lines, the cutting edge, the
&ldquo;no one has done this before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today where tens of billions of computing
devices&#x2014;nearly all capable of running rings around that first NASA
computer&#x2014;are doing computations big and small in every corner of the
world. Yes, most of these calculations are relatively simple, but many
are quite complex. This is the sort of math that, pre-Computer Age,
was to be found only in dense books and dry collections of tables, on
classroom and office blackboards, and, most mysteriously, as &ldquo;mental
representations&rdquo; in the brains of that small cadre of people called
<i>mathematicians</i>. <font color = "#650d1c">And so today we
should not underestimate the significance, the breadth and scope, the

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">Any notation for giving instructions is a programming language.</font>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
and, yes, giving a computer &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; is what we&rsquo;re doing with
programming. And yet to this day we don&rsquo;t fully understand how humans
convey knowledge, instructions. Frankly, we don&rsquo;t really know how one
human teaches math to another. Similarly, the debate continues over
how we should &ldquo;do math&rdquo; on a computer. But at some stage of one human
teaching, sharing math with another human, the teacher and student get
on the same page. The student catches on, &ldquo;syncs up&rdquo; their
understanding with the teacher&rsquo;s, and the knowledge is duly conveyed,
mathematical abstraction grokked. But if we don&rsquo;t really understand
how math is mentally represented in a human brain, nor how one mental
representation gets reconstructed in another&rsquo;s brain, then adding the
digital computer into this mix makes everything even more mysterious
and intriguing. In order to bring the computer into this process our

<font color = "#650d1c">CODE IS MATH, MATH IS CODE</font>

meaning the transfer, the syncing up of math must happen along with
producing code, i.e., <font color
= "#4715b3">we&rsquo;ll combine learning math with learning to <i>code</i> that

</p>

<p>
Contrary to what various &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; promoters<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Most &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; programs are rushed oversimplifications
primarily geared towards only a narrow part of the broad IT
world. User-interface (UI) coding is emphasized, while the other
branches, e.g., data management, systems programming, and especially
computational-numerical programming aren&rsquo;t covered or given
short-shrift.
</span> might say,
the programming part of this puzzle cannot be just a stand-alone boot
camp-style cram session. <i>Oh no,</i> you might say, <i>there&rsquo;s already so
much math to learn, and here&rsquo;s yet another thing to learn!</i> Yes and
no. Yes, it will be challenging, but we believe teaching math with
code and the code with math will make both realms come alive and be
fun to learn. We&rsquo;ve seen this pairing make beautiful music together,
and we want to build on this winning combination.
</p>

<p>
So if computer programs are written in computer programming languages,
what language shall we write our code in? This may seem a
controversial choice to some, but we&rsquo;ll center on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>, a <i>typed
functional</i><label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll dive into what a <i>typed</i> functional language is later&#x2026;
</span> language. One big reason Haskell is our choice is
that it is beyond a doubt the most math-centric, math-conscious
language there is. Pick up Haskell and it <i>oozes</i> math. But why choose
Haskell with its rather steep learning curve? Why not, say, an
easy-to-learn &ldquo;blub&rdquo; language?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#Blub">Blub</a> languages have earned this
not-so-flattering name by <i>not</i> being <i>functional</i> languages. What
does that mean? Let&rsquo;s begin to unpack this now.
</p>

<p>
When you write code in Blub, you are basically telling the
computer&#x2014;sometimes literally line-by-line&#x2014;what to do<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Literally line-for-line programming would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a>. But many
languages (e.g. C/C++) will have you explicitly, manually managing
your program&rsquo;s memory. That is to say, <i>memory management</i> is done by
the programmer and not automatically handled behind the scenes as it
now is in most modern languages. This is a hold-over from the early
days of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann machine</a>-based digital computers of
the 1950s.
</span>. This
is called <i>imperative</i> programming, i.e., each line is a command, an
imperative instruction. A functional language, on the other hand, is
based primarily on the mathematical concept of a
<i>function</i>. Functional languages are consider to be
<i>declarative</i><label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">this article</a> on declarative programming.
</span> languages. One main advantage of being declarative
and function-based in a mathematical sense is that our code will
conform to math function behavior, that is, when we put something into
a computation we get back exactly <i>one</i> answer&#x2014;and not one answer
now, then perhaps a different, unexpected answer the next time, on and
on. This might seem too hair-splittingly abstract so early in our
discussion, but functional programming&rsquo;s only-one-output feature is an
absolute necessity for computational predictability<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll discuss <i>referential transparency</i>, the technical term
for this idea, later, but in the
meantime you might want to take a crack at the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">here</a>.
</span>. Being able
to know and trust your code helps reduce bugs and errors that may crop
up as rude surprises when your program suddenly does something other
than what you expected it to do. There&rsquo;s a very big push these days to
make code &ldquo;provable,&rdquo; i.e., guaranteed to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to and
not what it&rsquo;s not supposed to do. Haskell is at the base of this
mountain.
</p>

<p>
Again, this only-one-answer predicability is built in to math
functions&#x2014;right?<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
When did you first hear about this? In a future section we&rsquo;ll
discuss middle-school math notions about linear functions plotted
on a Cartesian coordinate system.
</span> Yes, it is. And why this is true can be seen
in how math defines functions. We&rsquo;ll soon take a fairly detailed dive
into exactly what a math function is and why it&rsquo;s so important in
functional programming.
</p>

<p>
So if not Blub, why not a CAS<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
CAS is short for <i>computer algebra system</i>. Wikipedia has a good
article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">here</a>.
</span>, i.e., a math software package
like <i>MatLab</i>, <i>Wolfram</i>, or <i>Mathematica</i>, or a numerical package
available with Python such as <i>SymPy</i>? The short answer is we really
should learn to do hands-on programming. Why? Because software
packages with ready-made plug-and-chug solutions won&rsquo;t help us learn
to negotiate the real computationally-based STEM world. <i>But I&rsquo;ve
heard Python is very popular for math stuff</i>, you might say. For an
analogy, doing math with Python is like eating soup with a butter
knife (C++ with a steak knife). Haskell &#x2014; for many
reasons &#x2014; is like eating soup with a spoon. It&rsquo;s the best utensil.
</p>

<p>
Learning Haskell will fall into two categories: A) theory deep dives
and B) toolbox-building. A deep dive will take us on an exploration of
just how and why Haskell is doing something the way it does. There is
math theory is behind Haskell&rsquo;s ways, and we&rsquo;ll look into some of
method behind the seeming madness. Again, there&rsquo;s no other language
like Haskell<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
&#x2026;except for its siblings in the typed functional sphere SML,
Ocaml, and F#.
</span> Toolbox-building, on the other hand, will be more
&ldquo;learn to code,&rdquo; only with Haskell, i.e., figuring out what its
syntax, semantics, its <i>first principles</i> hands-on.

<h3 id="orgd3b29c5"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Math is abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
We believe anyone can do math, not because we&rsquo;re cheery, sunny
optimists, but because it&rsquo;s just a fact. But why then is math is so
difficult to learn for so many people? We believe the learning
problems arise because, again, <i>we really don&rsquo;t understand how the
human mind deals with abstraction</i>. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Luria">Alexander Luria</a>&rsquo;s
groundbreaking studies of the IQs of pre-literate people in the Caucus
Mountains, we&rsquo;ve gradually come to see abstraction as a much more
complicated beast than before<label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See <a href="https://youtu.be/9vpqilhW9uI">James Flynn</a>&rsquo;s TED talk, and read the first chapter of James
Gleick&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood">The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</a></i>.
</span>. Long story shortened, math can
be a very imposing vertical wall of abstraction. And, as Luria
discovered, there may exist social and cultural biases, actual
social-psychological resistance <i>against</i> abstraction. We cannot
simply assume that any and all abstraction and symbolism can and will
be acceptable to our math audience<label for="12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The classic line, &ldquo;What is this for? Why are we doing this?&rdquo;
is the elephant in the middle of the math classroom.
</span>. But if we approach the
abstraction curve with respect for its difficulty and steepness and we
don&rsquo;t resort to force or hand-waving<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
To <i>hand-wave</i> in science is to dismiss or downplay
complexity, to skip over or sweep something difficult under the
rug. We will avoid hand-waving at all costs.
</span>, we can master deeper
symbolism and abstraction. We must build up our abstraction receptor
sites in our brains, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
By the way, mathematics is just as much about words as it is about
numbers and formulae. Of course some math doesn&rsquo;t require any
words. There is the story of an American math professor who
&ldquo;translated&rdquo; Russian math books&#x2014;without understanding a word of
Russian. But that is very rare. A typical upper-level math text on,
e.g., abstract algebra, will have the reader weighing, pondering every
word in every sentence, over and over. You may spend a week trying to
wrap your head around just one page of one chapter. Hence, we need to
develop a very sharp, precise and exacting focus on what words really
mean, what they really imply. <i>And</i> we need to expand our math and
computer science vocabulary. A doctor who had just graduated from
medical school reported his school had emphasized to what seemed an
extreme degree knowing terminology, remembering sheer masses of
words. This will be similar. Get the words and their precise meaning
down&#x2014;and the learning will go much smoother; otherwise, every
sentence risks becoming bogged down in confusion.

<p>
Human vision happens in parallel. All the objects in our field of
vision hit our eyes and brain all at once, in parallel. However, we
speak, hear, learn serially. That is to say, we receive words as a
stream, a string, one element at a time, one atom of information after
the other. Math is serial. We <i>read</i> a math formula from
left-to-right, just like it was a sentence. We read a math proof top
to bottom. We read a <i>string</i> of numbers, again, left-to-right
serially. But if you don&rsquo;t understand something in a math lecture
early on&#x2014;you might be lost for the rest of the lecture. That&rsquo;s
because the lecture is coming at you in serial, and everything
happening right now is dependent on your having understood what came
before. Therefore, everything written, language or math, is one piece
after the next; and it&rsquo;s then up to our minds to take in the serial
stream and process it properly into some mental representation whole.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, a human mental representation of math is a very
amorphous, quasi-parallel beast. Really, we don&rsquo;t know much about how
the human mind houses and processes math. So if math on a chalkboard
or in a book is like sheet music&rsquo;s notes on a page, how do we &ldquo;play&rdquo;
math?  Today, we &ldquo;play&rdquo; math on our new instrument: the digital
computer.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
One big, <i>big</i> mistake in the teaching and learning of math is when we
resort to <i>conditioning</i>. When circus animal trainers train (torture)
their animals, they simply repeat routines over and over until the
animal finally catches on. Does the rat being forced to negotiate a
maze or the lion to jump through a burning hoop know, understand what
the idea, the concept, the purpose is? No. They&rsquo;re simply in a
stimulus-response <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism#21st-century_behaviorism_(behavior_analysis)">behaviorist</a> loop.
</p>

<p>
This sort of human behaviorist conditioning can be in the form of
<i>rote</i> learning&#x2014;which everyone agrees these days is not the best
way. And yet how many times have you heard, in one form or another,
&ldquo;When you see this on the test, do this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another version of this is what the mathematician <a href="https://longformmath.com/">Jay Cummings</a> calls
<i>The Way</i>. So in your math class you start a new topic and you are
shown <i>The Way</i> to handle it. You see The Way used in examples, then
The Way is employed to solve the exercises at the end of the
chapter. And when you see problems of this topic on a test, you use
The Way. But learning math by simply piling up as many The Ways as
possible rarely leads to any deeper understanding of math, let alone
its purpose, let way alone its aesthetics or beauty.
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s the alternative to behaviorist conditioning, to rote, to The
Way learning?  Concept-based learning, getting above the details into
carefully constructed, carefully worded, carefully delineated
generalizations where similarities and patterns can be grouped and
mentally aggregated into a deeper understanding. Another technique is
to simply <i>triangulate</i>, i.e., hit the problem from different angles,
not be afraid to see off-beat examples. Yes, The Way is often
unavoidable, but with careful triangulation, deeper meaning can be
gleaned. More on all this learning psychology as we progress.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
The American public K-12 math curriculum is designed to be a smooth,
gradual on-ramp for further math, physics, and engineering studies at
the college level. This strategy started back in the Cold War Era when
we thought we were behind the Russians because they were the first to
put a satellite in orbit in 1957. The so-called &ldquo;Sputnik crisis&rdquo;
resulted in a scramble to improve American math, science, and
engineering. Problematic is how this ancient curriculum does
practically nothing to prepare students for the ever-growing,
evermore-important sector of applied computational math and computer
science. Today&rsquo;s incoming college Freshmen choosing computer science
are confronted with many strange and alien concepts they&rsquo;ve never seen
before, the main one being <i>discrete</i> mathematics<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll learn plenty about discrete math as we go. But for a
quick introduction, consider a light switch that goes on or
off. That&rsquo;s two <i>discrete</i> states. The opposite of discrete would be
<i>continuous</i>. So think of a volume control knob on your radio,
<i>continuous</i> in that it <i>continually</i> changes, i.e., the change is so
small and incremental that they seem to blend together into one
<i>continuous</i> sweep from soft to loud.
</span>. Without any
previous exposure to the esoteric math of computer science, the first
two, three, four semesters of a college comp-sci degree are typically
a quick-time march to catch up<label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Imagine wanting to study math in college after having seen
absolutely <i>no</i> math K-12. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>
has taken steps to narrow this gap. Much of their math curriculum
attempts to expose kids to a discrete math, if not a computer algorithm
way of seeing math. But in our humble opinion it&rsquo;s far too little.
</span>. The result is, nation-wide,
high drop-out/flunk-out rates in CS departments&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but not necessarily at the elite universities with their
90th-percentile students<label for="16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
&#x2026;as I refer to them the <i>big boys and girls</i> who can do the
&ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo;&#x2026;
</span>. At the world-class STEM schools the
death march is fast and furious and the majority survive. At the
second-tier schools, however, this sort of pace usually isn&rsquo;t
maintained and corners are cut. And so a two-tiered world has emerged,
one group getting a solid CS education, the other getting a watered
down, vocational school version of CS. Here we will attempt to build
an on-ramp to computational/numerical math alongside, complimented by
coding that is, in turn, grounded back into solid math and computer
science. To accomplish this we&rsquo;ll explore the world of discrete math,
algorithms<label for="17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="17" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of <i>algorithms</i>. Very simply put, an
algorithm is a set of instructions, perhaps like a baking recipe, that
produces a mathematical cake. In computational math, we&rsquo;re basically
redoing, reimagining math formulae as algorithms which then can run on
computers. Lots and lots more about algorithms as we move along.
</span>, data structures, and numerical applications
parallel to their underlying mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Of course when the math and the code march together, the pace can slow
appreciably, since we might need to take get-up-to-speed side
trips. We&rsquo;ll often say, &ldquo;Check out this tutorial,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll follow a
link to an online resource and start supplemental &ldquo;apendix&rdquo;
learning. Of course whether or not you follow our advice, as well as
the level to which you grok it will be up to you. But expect

</span>, not <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a></i>. Typically, breadth-firsters want
to avoid &ldquo;getting lost in the weeds.&rdquo; Unfortunately, weeds are not to
be avoided in STEM, and you should develop experience in balancing
just how much weed-whacking you need to do in order to resume your
main investigation with insight and confidence. In the beginning, what
we offer here on-site will seem like just the tip of the iceberg, the
rest of the learning experience happening down off-site rabbit holes
(R-hole) quick (and not so quick) dips. Again, this is quite necessary
and unavoidable in order to understand best how math can be recast
into real-world code for real-world applications. Rabbit-holing is
definitely a part of real-world STEM.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll have a rating system for rabbit holes: a <i>critical</i> rabbit hole
(R<sub>C</sub>-hole) is a hole you need to go down, material you absolutely need
to learn; an <i>optional</i> rabbit hole (R<sub>O</sub>-hole) would help with the
material but is not absolutely necessary; and an <i>FYI</i> rabbit hole
(R<sub>FYI</sub>-hole) is a good source for expanding your understanding, but
isn&rsquo;t necessary to keep moving along. When appropriate, a list of
R-holes with the ⇲ symbol will be listed at the top of topic
headings. (Note: smaller, side excursions will simply be links in the
text.)

<p>
No doubt the typical, standard public school K-12 math curriculum is a
well thought out, gentle and gradual on-ramp for most higher-ed STEM
studies. But we won&rsquo;t always be so gradual. Often enough we&rsquo;ll be
&ldquo;deep end,&rdquo; as in throw you in the. Sounds brutal, you say, Are you
sure that&rsquo;s the best approach?
</p>

<p>
As approaches go, deep end is pretty much a given in the real STEM
world. Rarely will a new task or project be something you&rsquo;ve already
know everything about, something you can simply shake out of your
sleeve in no time then go home early. Rather, the STEM real world is
all about being baffled, out of your depth, overwhelmed&#x2014;until you
back off, take a few breaths, begin to think it through, pick it
apart, try this and that, do some rabbit-holing and
woodshedding<label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<i>Woodshedding</i> is a jazz music term meaning to learn and

</span>, ask around if anybody else has seen anything
similar &#x2026; which leads to failures then minor successes, followed
again by more failures and successes&#x2026; Again, this is how the real
STEM world is. The difference will be you&rsquo;re not our paid employee,
and it&rsquo;s up to you to set the pace and deadlines.

<h3 id="org89d1f02"><span class="section-number-3">1.8.</span> &#x2026;and a real-world toolset</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
Real-world work requires real-world tools. The first casualty of this
logos is we eschew &ldquo;graphing calculators.&rdquo; Why? Simply because there
are virtually no graphing calculators used in real-world
STEM. Instead, we will use a combination of plotting and graphics
software found in Haskell, along with long-establish workhorses like
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ">PGF/TikZ</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another perhaps controversial stance is we will not use commercial,
proprietary software. Instead, we&rsquo;ll base everything we&rsquo;re doing on
free software. Why? Because nearly all software used in STEM today is
in fact free-software based. Really?! Yes! <i>All cutting-edge STEM
software is free</i>. For that reason we&rsquo;ll be based in the Linux
operating system<label for="21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="21" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We use the latest version of Ubuntu. We have free Ubuntu
installed on cheap, used laptops from Ebay. For example a more than
adequate Thinkpad T470 (specify &ldquo;no operating system&rdquo;) can be had for
under $300. An even cheaper option would be a Thinkpad T450 (no
OS). Other brands will work as well. You can do just fine on a T430 as
well for ~$150. Whatever you do, try to get as much RAM as you can and
use an SSD drive.
</span>. Sure, you can use Mac or Windows, but we&rsquo;ll
assume, expect you&rsquo;re with us on a Linux-based system. One of the
tipping-point reasons for this decision is the Linux command line
environment; we feel everyone should get some experience with it.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll also use the <i>Emacs</i> text editor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a><label for="22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="22" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">the home site</a> and this <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">user site</a>.
</span> is far more than
a text editor. It&rsquo;s an entire cyber-universe of its own with tons of
add-on packages for mind-blowingly powerful functionality. And though
it can at times be hard to wrangle, Emacs&rsquo; usefulness and flexibility
is unprecedented. No other IDE or editing environment comes close to
its power and versatility.

<div id="outline-container-org67dd939" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67dd939"><span class="section-number-3">1.9.</span> The journey ahead; where are we going?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<p>
Where are we going? What do we expect to achieve? The Computer Age has
forced a split between what is now known as <i>continuous</i> math, i.e.,
the math of physics and engineering; and <i>discrete</i> math, the math
brought to the fore by the theoretical implications and requirements
of computers. We know what continuous math is&#x2014;as we&rsquo;ve mentioned,
the world&rsquo;s K-12 math curriculum is all about it. And we see what it
does, i.e., the engineering technology all around us. But where is the
computer-led side of science and technology going? Many today say into
AI, <i>artificial intelligence</i>. But teaching a computer to really think
has proven to be an elusive goal. The following joke will illuminate
</p>

<p>
<i>Two people are walking along the beach when one says, &ldquo;Look! A dead seagull!&rdquo; The other looks up into the sky and says, &ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
Of course this is funny to us, because we consider it daft to assume
that just because seagulls are birds spending most of their lives
sailing the coastal breezes, that when one dies it would remain
aloft. But a computer scientist might not laugh. Why? Because of the
concept of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical entailment</a></i>. In our joke, the logic of a dead bird
being unable to fly is simply taken for granted. However, if we are
trying to program a computer to have what we consider intelligence we
must tell it literally everything it would need to know. We simply
cannot expect it to deduce, infer facts that are not deducible, not
logical entailments from the explicitly given facts.
</p>

<p>
Consider this sequence of objects: \(\{1,\; nickel,\; 10,\; quarter,
\;50, \;?\}\;\;\). What should the last element &ldquo;?&rdquo; be?  Having
experience with these sorts of aptitude test questions, most of us
know to say &ldquo;dollar.&rdquo; But to know that &ldquo;dollar&rdquo; completes the sequence
assumes much logical entailment. A whole string of facts must be in
place before we have the necessary depth of logic to figure this
out. The bottom line is, in the computer world you must build logical
entailment up very thoroughly, leaving nothing out.
</p>

<p>
Once we&rsquo;ve got some experience under our belts, we&rsquo;ll notice that the
numerous side trips, the rabbit-holing and woodshedding to fill in
gaps will decrease&#x2014;simply because we already know stuff and we&rsquo;re
getting the hang of things. As a result our turnaround time on getting
things done will shorten. Still, it will always be hard. STEM will
always be a tough and challenging uphill battle, but a very good, very
rewarding one at the end of the day. In short, we think it&rsquo;s the best,
the most noble path there is. And so with no further ado, let&rsquo;s start.

You still need a bottom line? All right then, do STEM because someone
will pay you to do it, i.e., it&rsquo;s an honest living.

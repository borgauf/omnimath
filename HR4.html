It&rsquo;s a Monday morning in late July and the von der Surwitz siblings
meet in a reserved study room at the main university library to go
over what their <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i> teacher, Professor
Chandra, had discussed with them at Novalis Tech Open House.
</p>

<p>
Checking Professor Chandra&rsquo;s course syllabus on her website, they had
already made online purchases of the two main texts for the course,
<i>The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming</i> by Kees Doets and
Jan van Eijck, and <i>Thinking as Computation</i> from Hector
Levesque. During the open house at the convention wing of the student
center, they sat around a table with the professor as she paged
through the texts and talked extemporaneously about what parts she
would handle and how. She also showed them some code on her laptop.
</p>

<p>
The professor encouraged them to dive into to the logic and sets
prereqs, along side of the first few chapters of <i>The Haskell
Road&#x2026;</i>, as well as to get through as much <i>Learn You a Haskell&#x2026;</i>
as possible.
</p>

<p>
Ursula von der Surwitz has plugged in her laptop to the big monitor
and is scrolling through some of her personal notes.
</p>

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So like
Professor Chandra said yesterday, we&rsquo;re going to do things in terms of
logic and set theory from here on out. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> And like she said,
with set theory we can properly define relations and function. All of
which sounds rather ominous. Like everything we thought we knew was
about to go away.<br />
[more agreement murmurs] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [paging through
<i>Haskell Road&#x2026;</i> ] Did anyone look at the first chapter? <br />
[all nod affirmative] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
Wasn&rsquo;t too bad. But I needed some of the <i>Learn You a Haskell&#x2026;</i> to
get me through. <br />
[murmurs of agreement] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> I think it&rsquo;s cool
how the whole prime number test, the greatest common divisor all
blended together. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Do you remember
that prime factorization way of figuring out unlike-denominator math?
<br />
[affirmative murmurs] <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> That was amazing
how Professor Chandra just put two fractions with huge unlike
denominators into this command line &#x2014; what was it she was using? <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> It started with an
R<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
That would be the programming language Racket where you can
simply put in, e.g., <br />
<code>&gt; (+ 1/3234 1/9437200)</code> <br />
and get back <br />
<code>4720217/15259952400</code> <br />
Haskell can do this as well, which we&rsquo;ll investigate.
</span>? <br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing]
Right, so he added these monster unlike denominator fractions &#x2014; and
it just spit out the answer in a split second <i>in rational form</i>! <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Then he worked
through an <i>algorithm</i> as to how it could have been done. <br />
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Using prime
factorization. Yeah, impressive.

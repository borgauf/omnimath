** Why sets?

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, mathematicians wanted to
create a ground floor for mathematics that would be fundamental,
theoretical, formal, and /abstracted/ enough in order base all of
mathematics. They developed *set theory* to be this base. German
mathematicians Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind are credited as the
originators of they called /Mengenlehre/.

For example, set theory allowed all manner of numbers to be formally
defined and grouped. It also allowed the Cartesian coordinate system
(CCS) to be formally based, as well as an exacting description of
relations and functions.

Cantor's contemporary, Gottlob Frege, came up with what was supposed
to be the definitive starter definition of a set, which later became
known as the /Schema of Comprehension/

\begin{align}
Y = \{x : \varphi\,(x)\}
\end{align}

(1) demonstrates the /set comprehension/ notation[fn:1], an abstraction tool
which we'll have a closer look at below. It reads

➝@@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@ /$Y$ is/equals the set of all $x$'s
such that they have the property $\varphi$/ @@html:</font>@@.

This emphasizes the importance of /properties/ on sets. Properties,
also known as /predicates/, act as a sort of filter, qualifier on
possible set members. Good. But there's one problem with (1), *it can
be proven false*. As it turned out, this particular wording allowed a
circular argument known as /Russell's Paradox/ after Bertrand Russell
that could not initially be resolved. He introduced the bizarre
predicate $X \notin X\;$, which made (1) illogical impossible

Russell said,

#+begin_quote
Consider the set $S$ whose elements are all those (and only those)
sets that are not members of themselves: $S = \{X:X\notin X\}\;\;$. So does
$S$ belong to $S\;$? If $S$ belongs to $S\;$ then $S$ is not a member
of itself, and so $S \notin S\;$. On the other hand, if $S \notin S\;$, then $S$
belongs to $S\;$.
#+end_quote

Got that? If not, it has been reworded into plain English
versions. One is known as the "Town Barber." So a town has a barber
who shaves all the men who do not shave themselves. Now, does the
barber shave himself?  Similar is this paradox

- the sentence below is false
- the sentence above is true

For a time, Russell's Paradox pulled the rug out from under the whole
idea of using set theory as a basis for mathematics. It was not until
mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel came up with a
variation of the Schema of Comprehension, called the /Schema of
Separation/, that set theory could go on being math's basis. What came
to be known as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with its solid /axioms/,
corrected this paradox by simply not allowing the idea of a set of all
sets. Obviously, allowing a /universal set/[fn:2] of all sets begs the
question if this supposedly universal set contains itself, and if it
does, is it truly the ultimate container[fn:3]?

** Back down to earth

Another more down-to-earth description of mathematical sets would be
to say

➝ @@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@
Sets are /unordered/ collections of /distinct objects/.
@@html:</font>@@

Here /unordered/ means no one element of a set is before or after
another. So a set is like a bag. You may reach in and pull any element
out at random[fn:4]. But then how do we make order out of unorder,
since, e.g., numbers have the property of being ordered? We'll look
into that at a formalistic set theoretical level.

/Distinct objects/ sounds clear enough, but this also means any
/repeated element/ in a set really only represent one truly distinct,
single thing ... which means an element only appears once in a set,
even though you may see it more than once ... which means duplicates
don't add anything ... which means we can always remove duplicate
elements and not change the set[fn:5]. For example

\begin{align*}
\{a,b,c\} = \{b,a,c\} = \{c,b,a\} = \{a,b,b,c,b\}
\end{align*}

are all the same set.

Sets can be /finite/, i.e., limited to a given numbers of elements. Or
sets can be /infinite/, i.e., an endless number of elements. For now
we'll deal with finite lists, but occasionally allude to infinite
sets. Representing an infinite set as a Haskell list, we utilize the
/range/ operator, e.g., ~[1,2..]~, which would continue building a
list of all positive integers endlessly. Be careful. Use only in
conjunction with a limiting function, e.g.,

#+name: b370432e-46b4-4bdf-b960-29d9905aa62a
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
take 10 [1,2..]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: b370432e-46b4-4bdf-b960-29d9905aa62a
: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

otherwise ~[1,2..]~ just by itself will run forever and lock up your
computer[fn:6].

** Describing sets

So far we've done some hand-waving at our formal set
notation. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation][Set-builder notation]] can be as simple as just listing out
the members of a set, e.g., $A = \{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$. This is known as
the /roster method/. This works --- for shorter finite sets. And we
can even throw in the intuitive idea of /ellipsis/, $\ldots\;\;$, when
we want to "continue this pattern," i.e., good for representing
infinite lists, e.g., $B = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}\;\;$.

But a more abstract depiction of sets is the /set comprehension/,
which we saw above. This is a mathematical description, a machine of
sorts, of what elements should be included in a set for building a
roster of set elements. In its simplest form we can say

\begin{align}
S = \{x\; |\; \varphi \; x\}
\end{align}

where the set $S$ is constructed from $x\;$, a representative
/variable/ in the algebraic sense, and $\varphi\;$, the /predicate/, applied
to $x\;$. Hence, the qualifying rule, $\varphi\;x\;$, creates a
true-or-false, in-or-out qualification for potential set members. The
pipe or vertical bar in between means "such that[fn:7]."  And so we
read (2) as @@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@ $S$ is the set of $x$'s
such that $\varphi\; x$ holds@@html:</font>@@. In other words, the elements
of $S$ are only those which pass the predicate $\varphi\;$'s test. But where
are the possible candidates for this predicate test coming from?

One variation of this basic set comprehension is to include on the
left of the pipe the /domain/ of the variable. For example, the set
$S_{\mathbb{R>0}}$ of all real numbers greater than $0$ could be

\begin{align*}
S_{\mathbb{R>0}} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \; | \; x \gt 0\}
\end{align*}

where on the left side we "pre-provide" a source of potential set
elements from $\mathbb{R}\;$, then "filter" them with our $x \gt 0\;$
predicate. This gives the set of all strictly positive real numbers,
which can also be written as $(0,\infty)\;$.

Consider intervals expressed as set comprehensions

\begin{align*}
(a,b) &= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; a < x < b\} \\
[\,a,b) &= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; a \leq x < b\} \\
(a,b\,] &= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; a < x \leq b\} \\
[\,a,b\,] &= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \;|\; a \leq x \leq b\}
\end{align*}

Again, we're assuming $\mathbb{R}\;$ to be the /set/ of all real
numbers, i.e., set theory has crept into our language.

Now, let's try a more complicated set comprehension

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{Q} = \{a \in \mathbb{R}\ \;|\; \exists\, p \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists\, q \in \mathbb{Z}\; [\,q \ne 0 \land aq = p\,]\}
\end{align*}

... or the set of rational numbers, i.e., real numbers expressible as
a ratio of two integers. Another way of saying this would be of the
general form $\{ f\; x \;|\; p\;x \}\;$

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{Q} = \{p/q \;|\; p, q \in \mathbb{Z},\; q \ne 0\}
\end{align*}

where we have the /function/ $f(p, q) = p/q\;\;$ left of the
pipe[fn:8]. Another example of a function on the left is

\begin{align*}
\{\sqrt{x} \;|\; x \in \{1,2,3,4\}\}
\end{align*}

Or as a Haskell list comprehension

#+name: 4d8eb251-6b7e-4479-922d-110d19bd2871
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[sqrt x | x <- [1,2,3,4]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 4d8eb251-6b7e-4479-922d-110d19bd2871
: [1.0,1.4142135623730951,1.7320508075688772,2.0]

Consider the following and try to understand why the left- and
right-hand sides of the /equivalence/, $\equiv\;$, are the same

\begin{align*}
\{ \Psi(x) \;|\; \Phi(x)\} \equiv \{y \;|\; \exists(x),\; y=\Psi(x) \land \Phi(x)\}
\end{align*}

For another example consider a system of linear equations

\begin{align*}
2x - 4y &= 6 \\
3x - 6x &= 9
\end{align*}

If we do row manipulations, we see these are actually the same
equation. Now, let's express one of them as a comprehension

\begin{align*}
\{(x,y) \;|\; 2x - 4y = 6\}
\end{align*}

Let's try Haskell versions

#+name: 220d74fd-eea3-4074-9e49-23e5e2c50f8e
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(x,y) | x <- [1..20], y <- [1..20], 2*x - 4*y == 6]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 220d74fd-eea3-4074-9e49-23e5e2c50f8e
: [(5,1),(7,2),(9,3),(11,4),(13,5),(15,6),(17,7),(19,8)]

#+name: 92d17829-6352-465f-ab41-ddf463d83909
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(x,y) | x <- [1..20], y <- [1..20], (2*x - 4*y == 6) || (3*x - 6*y == 9)]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 92d17829-6352-465f-ab41-ddf463d83909
: [(5,1),(7,2),(9,3),(11,4),(13,5),(15,6),(17,7),(19,8)]

These are the possible values of $x$ and $y$ between $1$ and $20\;$.


** Doing sets in Haskell

Haskell does have its own complete version of math sets which can be
imported. However, for didactic purposes we will start out with an
approximation of mathematical sets using Haskell's /list/ data
structure[fn:9].

At first glance a math set and a Haskell list look the same, e.g., $A
= \{1,2,3,4\}\;$ on the math text page and

#+name: 76e51bcf-6861-4a24-844a-767bf397dfc2
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
a = [1,2,3,4]
#+end_src

on the computer screen look similar. And once Haskell has evaluated
the above expression, your computer knows about four elements
considered together, which are then referred to by the symbol ~a~. But
unlike a math set, a Haskell list /does/ care about order and /does/
care about duplicates. This means

\begin{align*}
A &= \{1,2,3,4\} \\
&= \{1,2,3,4,2,1\} \\
&= \{3,4,2,1\}
\end{align*}

might all be the same set, but

#+name: d2fb9599-0a53-4d2c-8411-9da0d7d795f8
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
a = [1,2,3,4] b = [1,2,3,4,2,1] c = [3,4,2,1]
#+end_src

are different lists. Again, think of a Haskell list as a /sequence/ of
like-typed elements. These constraints, however, can be worked around
if we want a Haskell list to represent a math set.

** ⇲ Haskell aside: Duplicates


So if our "list-as-set" shouldn't have duplicates, then we need a
means of removing them. There is built-in (~Data.List~) ~delete~ which
returns a new list[fn:10] with the first instance of the argument missing

#+name: 3b5747f7-dd38-4fd5-af05-62db3d8477af
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
import Data.List
#+end_src

#+name: aa504dda-906b-4d27-a1ef-d40f7448a403
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delete 1 [1,2,3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: aa504dda-906b-4d27-a1ef-d40f7448a403
: [2,3]

#+name: 82d298b5-414f-4ace-b38a-0123120adda6
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delete 1 [1,2,3,1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 82d298b5-414f-4ace-b38a-0123120adda6
: [2,3,1]

As we see above, ~delete~ is too primitive to consider duplicates. How
could we fix this? Playing around, we could ~reverse~ the list  

#+name: 2035aafc-c78f-41a1-8292-efeb5978b868
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
reverse [1,2,3,1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 2035aafc-c78f-41a1-8292-efeb5978b868
: [1,3,2,1]

and at least take off that back ~1~, then reverse again to get it back
to its normal list order. This leverages Haskell's higher-order
function /composition/

#+name: 23af6cde-752d-4b65-83c9-8dc9ead60219
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
delLast1 = reverse . delete 1 . reverse
#+end_src

#+name: 5cb1be90-acb3-496c-a6c9-113728943fbe
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delLast1 [1,2,3,1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 5cb1be90-acb3-496c-a6c9-113728943fbe
: [1,2,3]

For practice we create our own ~delete'~

#+name: 81e6dc62-8170-4d87-91a3-e74ef23623e5
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
:{
delete' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a]
delete' _ [] = []
delete' y (x:xs) | x == y = delete' y xs
                 | otherwise = x : delete' y xs
:}
#+end_src

#+name: fac363a3-00f9-4994-8f0d-9d01927c1e01
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delete' 1 [5,1,2,3,1,3,1]
#+end_src

#+Results: fac363a3-00f9-4994-8f0d-9d01927c1e01
: [5,2,3,3]

We could specify /which/ element is to be removed if there are
duplicates

#+name: c915b856-e035-4054-8dd9-125d47f5a169
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
:{
-- delDup :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a]
delDup _ _ [] = []
delDup n y (x:xs) | ((x == y) && (n == 1)) = xs
                  | (x /= y) = x : delDup n y xs
                  | otherwise = x : delDup (n-1) y xs
:}
#+end_src

Remove the first occurrence of ~6~

#+name: 3f8f665f-afc1-4a23-ba92-9a3fb46bb421
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delDup 1 6 [1,2,3,1,1,2,4,6,1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 3f8f665f-afc1-4a23-ba92-9a3fb46bb421
: [1,2,3,1,1,2,4,1]

or the second occurrence of ~1~

#+name: fff5e49c-5216-465a-9f28-01353d8c572a
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
delDup 2 1 [1,2,3,1,1,2,4,6,1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: fff5e49c-5216-465a-9f28-01353d8c572a
: [1,2,3,1,2,4,6,1]

But again, this isn't getting rid of all duplicates. We would need a
function that took each element of the list and searched the rest of
the list for duplicates, removing any found.

One quick-and-dirty way just like ~delete'~ above is to leverage
~elem~

#+name: 9f369f22-83e5-4769-a9fe-aeccf952c43c
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
:{
rmDups :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
rmDups [] = []
rmDups (x:xs)   | x `elem` xs = rmDups xs

#+end_src

: [3,2,4,6,1]

But this is complex in that it takes many steps[fn:11]. Another
approach that is not so complex is to again /compose/ useful functions

** Set abstraction

Sets become considerably more abstract when we begin to formalize and
abstract a set's interactions with itself and other sets. If, for
example, we have the set $A = \{1,2,3,4\}\;$ and we want $A$ be a
/totally ordered set/, we must be able to compare any two elements of
$A$ for sameness, for greater- or less-ness. This may seem formalistic
trivial tedious[fn:12], but consider a set of colors $C = \{Red, Green,
Blue, Yellow\}\quad$. Yes, intuitively, any two elements of $C$ may be
the same, equal or not, but how can we talk about one color being
greater or less than another color[fn:13]?

In this discussion we will speak of /relations/, i.e., operations on a
set that establish rules for how set elements relate to one
another. But initially we'll do this at an intuitive level, without
going into exacting mathematical detail as to what a relation really
is. That comes a bit later.

One way we can express a relation on a set is to create a separate set
made up of the given set's elements. So, for the set $A =
\{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$ let us create a /less than/ set

\begin{align*}
R_{A\,:\,x \lt y} = \{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)\}
\end{align*}

Here we have created a set of pairs, as with Cartesian coordinate
pairs, made up of all the elements of $A$ conforming to the $x \lt y\;$
property. Hence, in this case the property or /predicate/ $\varphi$ is $x \lt
y\;$.

This is similar to, e.g., having a grocery list on one piece of paper,
then on another piece of paper rearranging the grocery items into
fresh, frozen/cooled, and dry/canned categories. Then on a third piece
of paper listing the grocery items by cheapest to most expensive per
unit weight. Now you have three grocery lists: the original and two
lists that express useful relationships on the original grocery list.

Let's create with a Haskell /list comprehension/ a /greater than or
equal to/ relation among the elements of $A = \{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$

#+name: f0e504b9-68dc-453f-acf1-f27ac5045f05
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(x,y) | y <- [1..4], x <- [1..4], x >= y]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: f0e504b9-68dc-453f-acf1-f27ac5045f05
: [(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4)]

** 🟄Logical sum, logical product

If $A$ and $B$ are two sets, then $A \cup B\;$ (or $A \lor B\;$) is the
/union/ of $A$ and $B\;$. This is also called a /logical or/ since we
are combining the elements of $A$ and $B$ in such a way that the
result contains everything in /both/ $A$ /and/ $B\;$; hence, a union
of two sets will contain elements from one set *or* the
other[fn:14]. Yes, this is a tricky dance semantically between how we
normally use /and/ and /or/. It's most formal name is /logical
disjunction/.

#+begin_export html
<img src="./images/union.svg" width="300px" style="padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px" alt="Union" class="center">
<span class="cap">Logical disjunction.</span>
#+end_export

The /truth table/ for logical disjunction would be[fn:15]

| A     | B     | A \lor B |
|-------+-------+-------|
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | True  |
| False | False | False |


An /intersection/ of $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B\;$ (or $A \land B\;$) --- also
called a /logical product/, /logical and/ and most formally /logical
conjunction/ --- is made up exclusively of the shared elements in
/both/ $A$ and $B\;$.

<img src="./images/intersection.svg" width="300px" style="padding: 15px 0px 0px 0px" alt="Union" class="center">

and the truth table for logical conjunction is[fn:16]

| A     | B     | A \land B |
|-------+-------+-------|
| True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | False |
| False | True  | False |
| False | False | False |

⇲ *Mind-bender*: What about the statement[fn:17]

\begin{align}
\lnot\; (\lnot\; A \;\lor\; \lnot\; B)\;=\;A \land B
\end{align}

Is this true, i.e., can we create logical conjunction out of negation
and logical disjunction? Just puzzling it out is hard. But if we look
at the last line of the logical disjunction truth table ~False |
False | False~, then we see that negating $A\;$, $B\;$ and $A \lor B\;$,
as we see on the left side of (3), makes it the same as the logical
conjunction's first line ~True | True | True~. Likewise, sticking in
any of the other truth table values translates one to the other. So
yes, they are equivalent. Keep this machine-like logic translation in
mind. We'll see it later.

*** Ordering real numbers

Real numbers? Why real numbers? Isn't computer science more interested
in whole numbers and discrete things? Yes, but in order to talk about
the OFA (and then move forward with sets) we have to work with the
reals. Why?  Because certain operations on whole numbers are not
possible. For example, to properly define the OFA we will need to be
able to solve $ax = 1\;$ for $x\;$ for any $a \in \mathbb{R}\;\;$. But
since natural numbers $\mathbb{N}\;$ and integers $\mathbb{Z}\;\;$
have no rationals (fractions), we cannot use them. Solving $ax =
1\;\;$ for $x\;$ is just another way of saying we need any number
$a\;$ to have an inverse $1/a\;\;$. Again, whole numbers integrals
have no concept of inverse/reciprocal.

In higher math, i.e., /abstract algebra/, they speak of /fields/,
/groups/, and /rings/. These concepts lend a high degree of
abstraction to the idea of numbers. And so

@@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@ The /field of real numbers/,
$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times, \leq)\;$, is the set of real numbers under the two
operations of addition and multiplication, with an ordering
$\leq\;$. @@html:</font>@@






*** Set properties

It its purest form, axiomatic[fn:18] set theory only deals with sets
as the most basic and fundamental entities --- not even considering
their elements. Thus, an entire abstract world is built around just
the sets themselves. Beginners, used to numbers, are often baffled by
this new abstraction, having grown up in a world of the natural
counting numbers, of whole number integers with the possibility of
negative values, of numbers expressed as fractions, numbers expressed
with unlimited decimal exactness, numbers that never have a decimal or
fractional resolution, and then even so-called imaginary numbers built
out of the impossible number $\sqrt{-1}\;\;$. Numbers are an
infinitely large bag of precise, high-resolution objects with all
manner of hands-on manipulations happening to them. Sets, on the other
hand, are like opaque blocks meant to be moved around by seemingly
arcane, often trivial-sounding rules.

Even more problematic is how set theory doesn't always hold to its
axiomatic sets-only philosophy. Yes, the other aspect of sets is how
/relations/ are built among their elements. We'll start this dance
between sets-only and set-with-elements by considering the idea of a
/universal set/, $\mathbb{U}\;$, by which we mean some /hyper-set/
above and including all /subsets/ of a certain type. For example, all
the numbers on a number line, e.g., integers, reals, etc., could be a
universal set relative to bunches of these numbers gathered into
subsets of that universal set[fn:19]. Hence, a universal set will be
in some context of its subsets.



Recall the idea of a property $\varphi$ on a set. Here we're speaking of
sets as holders of elements. One trivial property would be $S = \{x
\;|\; \varphi\, (x) = x\}\;\;$, which is simply all the elements of the set
$S\;\;$. The opposite in a restricted, non-paradoxical set world would
be $\varnothing = \{x \;|\; \varphi\, (x) \neq x\}\;\;$, or the /empty
set/. We're literally saying, "All $x\;$ with the property of not
being $x\;$."  Yes, odd. But a set made up of elements that have the
property of not being equal to themselves we must simply declare as
impossible, /no such elements/, i.e., an empty set.

*** Subsets

A set $A$ is a /subset/ of set $B$ if there are no elements of $A$
that are not in $B\;$. Hence, $A$ is contained in $B\;$. Symbol-wise
we write $A \subseteq B\;\;$ and this actually indicates "contained by
or equal to". Another sort of subset is the /proper subset/ $A \subset B\;$
where $A$ is wholly contained in $B\;$ but they are not equal, i.e.,
$A$ is contained by $B\;$ but at least one element smaller than $B\;$.

But now let's go back into just-sets axiomatic set theory. As it so
happens, there are parallels between a subset relation $A \subseteq
B\;$ and the general order relation $x \leq y\;$ between numbers. Sort
of.

1. $A \subseteq A\;$.
2. If $A \subseteq B\;$ and $B \subseteq A\;$, then $A = B\;$.
3. If $A \subseteq B\;$ and $B \subseteq C\;$, then $A \subseteq C\;$.

By these three rules $A \subseteq B\;$ parallels the order relation $a
\leq b\;$; hence, $A \subseteq B\;$ can be considered an /order
relation/. So let's simply substitute $\leq$ for $\subseteq\;$.

- By 1. the numeric version would be $a \leq a\;$.[fn:20]
- By 2. if $x \leq y\;$ and $y \leq x\;$, then $x = y\;$.
- By 3. if $x \leq y\;$ and $y \leq z\;$, then $x \leq z\;$.

But there is a slight hitch in the interchangeability of $\leq$ with
$\subseteq\;$. With /any/ two numbers we will have either $x \leq y\;$ or
$y \leq x\;$, i.e., one number is before, abreast with, or after another
--- but we can't really say that about all sets. For example if $A =
\{1,2,3\}\;$ and $B = \{2,3,4\}\;$ then we cannot have 2. or 3. since
neither $A \subseteq B\;$ nor $B \subseteq A\;$. Therefore we have to
fall back to saying $A \subseteq B\;$ is a /partial ordering among
sets/, while $x \leq y\;$ defines a /complete ordering among
numbers/. Yes, but why do we bother with this comparison? Because in
Haskell --- and by association computer theory --- keys on such
parallels. More to come on this front.

Let's list some more rules

4. [@4]$\varnothing \subseteq A\;\;$ for any set $A$.
5. $A \subseteq \mathbb{U}\;$.

The "proof" of 4. is simply that $\varnothing \subseteq A\;\;$ could
only be false if $\varnothing$ as a set contained an element that was
not an element of $A\;$, but since $\varnothing$ contains no such
thing due to its emptiness, we never have this situation, no matter
what $A$ has for elements. Right. Such are math proofs.

Now, let's get back to logical sums and logical products. Let's again
have $A = \{1,2,3\}\;\;$ and $B = \{2,3,4\}\;$. Then $A \lor B =
\{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$ and $A \land B = \{2,3\}\;\;$. Rules for sums and
products are

6. [@6]$A \lor B = B \lor A\;\;$ ...or /commutativity/.
7. $A \land B = B \land A\;\;$ ...again /commutativity/.
8. $A \lor (B \lor C) = (A \lor B) \lor C\quad$ ...or /associativity/.
9. $A \land (B \land C) = (A \land B) \land C\quad$ ...again /associativity/.
10. $A \lor A = A\quad$ ...huh, what's this?!
11. $A \land A = A\quad$ ...again, what's going on here?!
12. $A \land (B \lor C) = (A \land B) \lor (A \land C) \quad$ ...the /distributive/ law.
13. $A \lor (B \land C) = (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C) \quad$ ...do numbers do this?
14. $A \lor \varnothing = A\quad$.
15. $A \land \mathbb{U} = A\quad$ ...what would be the number analogy?
16. $A \lor \mathbb{U} = \mathbb{U} \quad$ ...again, the parallel to numbers?
17. $A \land \varnothing = \varnothing \quad$ ...yes, numbers do this.
18. $A \subseteq B \equiv A \lor B = B \equiv A \land B = A \quad$ ...numbers do this?

Again, if we compare *logical disjunction to addition* and *logical
conjunction to multiplication*,




Now, how do we bring this sort of abstraction into the computer?

** Ordering: sets and regular algebraic math
:RESOURCES:
- [[cite:&courant1996mathematics]]
:END:

There are two big ideas about numbers --- beyond their main uses as
indicators of quantity and enumerating things. They are /equivalence/
and /order/. We'll talk about order here. But why bring in set theory?
Set theory may seem a strange abstraction off in its own world, but
there exists enlightening overlap between handling sets and handling
numbers vis-à-vis order. If we think about ordinary addition and
multiplication, the set version of these is /union/ or /logical sum/
for addition, and /intersection/ or /logical product/ for
multiplication. But before we go further, let's formalize an
interesting corner of numbers by looking at the /complete ordered
field axioms/ (OFA). It turns out the whole idea of /ordering/ things
is a very important, fundamental concept in math.

Let's take a stab at the idea of ordering. Intuitively, we can say
that @@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@ a collection of elements is
ordered if choosing any given element, it is either /before/ another,
/alongside/ another, or /ahead of/ another.  @@html:</font>@@ But we
can't turn this definition into computer code very easily. It is too
naive and intuitive. We delve into abstract mathematics in order to
find mathematical forms that it can be translated into code
expressions to run on a computer.

** Colors

*** Formalizing color mathematically

Above, we mentioned a possible set where the elements were not
numbers, rather, /colors/. But how can we do math with colors? With
numbers we have many possible operations and relationships between
sets of numbers, each of which represents a quantity. But how can we
objectively talk about orderings such as "greater than" with a set of
colors?

In the world of abstract algebra and discrete mathematics the concept
of sets is sufficiently formal and abstract to allow us to construct
something mathematical out of a set of colors. As we saw above, we
formalized, /codified/ the idea of "greater than" for the set $A =
\{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$ by creating a separate set $R_{A\,:\,x \lt y}$ to hold all
possible pairs of $A$ elements that expressed a greater-than
relationship. That is to say, we took the greater than relationship on
our set out of the ether, out of our intuitive mental representation
and put it down in black-and-white.

Addition and subtraction. In everyday life we take the arithmetic of
addition and subtraction for granted. Again, we have an intuitive
mental representation of these two operations without having to think
about how addition is commutative and associative, while subtraction
is neither nor[fn:21]. For example, we typically don't think about
switching from the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ to the /integers/
$\mathbb{Z}$ (whole numbers including negatives) when we evaluate
something like $3 - 5\;$. So how would we add colors? But then how do
we add sets[fn:22]? We'll first look at how Haskell creates a color
type.

*** Haskell ~Color~

Haskell is not an object-oriented language, rather, a typed language,
which in our case means we first need to define a /type/ for colors,
not an object as you would with C++, Java, Ruby, or Python. We start
by defining our ~Color~ type

#+name: 2f2aea18-b10e-4821-999a-018db8b8308c
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data Color = Red | Yellow | Blue | Green | Purple | Orange | Brown deriving (Show,Eq,Enum)
#+end_src


~Color~ has seven /tags/ or /data constructors/, i.e., ~Red~,
~Yellow~, ... ~Brown~ are individual tag-constructors[fn:23]. So let's
create a list of colors of type ~Color~

#+name: 31a4b742-077b-419a-8cd1-b822f40c2cf7
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
myColor1 = [Blue,Orange,Yellow]
#+end_src

#+name: b97829e6-b2b6-454e-8dc8-e40c835de662
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
myColor1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: b97829e6-b2b6-454e-8dc8-e40c835de662
: [Blue,Orange,Yellow]

Notice how our ~Color~ type definition almost looks like a set itself,
a sort of container holding all seven of the possible colors

#+name: 4f60fdc0-df8c-446f-b289-49ac38fa7e12
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[a | a <- [(Red::Color)..]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 4f60fdc0-df8c-446f-b289-49ac38fa7e12
: [Red,Yellow,Blue,Green,Purple,Orange,Brown]

Technically speaking, a data constructor like ~Red~ or ~Green~ is also
function; however, in this case they take no arguments but return a
constant[fn:24] when invoked, namely a variable the same as the data
constructor itself. This may sound formalistic-odd, so let's give an
example where the type definition looks and acts more function-like

#+name: f4ab8cec-3485-49fc-92f5-7c6a0dbcddf4
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data ColorInt = RedI Int | YellowI Int | BlueI Int | GreenI Int | PurpleI Int | OrangeI Int | BrownI Int deriving (Show,Eq)
#+end_src

#+name: 8c0dfb09-76f3-44da-8699-b9072d16274c
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
myCInt1 = [RedI 5, GreenI 2, PurpleI 6, BrownI 1]
#+end_src

#+name: 21cb9d5a-0183-4da7-9858-a91a17c6b43e
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
myCInt1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 21cb9d5a-0183-4da7-9858-a91a17c6b43e
: [RedI 5,GreenI 2,PurpleI 6,BrownI 1]

So with ~ColorInt~ we've upped the /arity/ of our data constructors on
the right of the equation by one and now they take one argument, an
~Int~ value --- perhaps to indicate the intensity of the color. Notice
also we had to change the names of the ~ColorInt~ data constructors so
as not to clash with our previous ~Color~'s data constructors. But
again, data constructors behave like functions that return a value of
the data type[fn:25]. In the case of ~RedI 5~ no calculation upon
evaluation was made, rather, the value ~RedI 5~ was returned.

*** The sum type

Both ~Color~ and ~ColorInt~ are what are referred to in Haskell as
/sum/ types[fn:26] ... as opposed to /product/ types. This difference
goes back to set theory and whether we are dealing with a union or an
intersection of sets --- as we discussed above. But we also go back
the fundamental issue of counting things and putting them
together. For example, let's say we have four things in one group and
two things in another group, and neither group shares things. This
means the things in the two groups in no way overlap. They are
/disjoint/, and putting them together will behave like putting two
sets together that share nothing, no element overlap.

Consider three streets with clothing shops. Grant Street has two
clothing shops; Lincoln Street has one clothing shop; and Lee Street
has two clothing shops. Of course no street "shares" any shop
What does this look like in set theory or
Venn diagrams when we put them together?

If we take any two sets, e.g., $A = \{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$ and $B =
\{3,4,5,6\}\;\;$, then the set /union/ or /logical sum/ $A \cup B =
\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\;\;\;$, which is just what we expect since sets do not
suffer duplicates. In other words, the overlap is not duplicated in
the resolution.

If we want a new Haskell list made up of the elements from $A$ /or/
$B\;$, and we try a simple concatenation

#+name: 29547818-ce1e-44ff-ad33-981237f82966
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[1,2,3,4] ++ [3,4,5,6]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 29547818-ce1e-44ff-ad33-981237f82966
: [1,2,3,4,3,4,5,6]

...we have a problem. Again, lists have duplicates. Let's reexamine
the definition of $A \cup B\;$, a set /union/

\begin{align*}
A \cup B = \{x \;|\; x \in A \;\lor\; x \in B\}
\end{align*}

We can leverage this basic "or-ness," but we have to include the
removal of duplicates

#+name: 673b1826-da41-4072-8ed8-06535215ca36
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
:{
myUnion :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
myUnion [] ys = ys
myUnion (x:xs) ys = if (elem x xs) || (elem x ys)
                    then x : myUnion (filter (/=x) xs) (filter (/=x) ys)
                    else x : myUnion xs ys
:}
#+end_src

This seems to work

#+name: ddcf0f54-93cc-475d-a862-9634bb1e8561
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
myUnion [1,2,3,4,1] [3,4,5,6]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: ddcf0f54-93cc-475d-a862-9634bb1e8561
: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

But what if there's a duplicate in the second list?

#+name: dd01f6c5-47fc-43a2-aee2-222aee3cadb4
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
myUnion [1,2,3,4] [2,3,5,5,6,7]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: dd01f6c5-47fc-43a2-aee2-222aee3cadb4
: [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7]

We could kludge something

#+name: 628d88ec-1da8-4f59-947e-f1a5f6de3a36
#+begin_src haskell :results silent :exports code
:{
myUnion2 :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
myUnion2 [] ys = nub ys
myUnion2 (x:xs) ys = if (elem x xs) || (elem x ys)
                    then x : myUnion2 (filter (/= x) xs) (filter (/=x) ys)
                    else x : myUnion2 xs ys
:}
#+end_src

#+name: cb464947-fb3e-46e0-8b0b-ba5fe5c94b62
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
myUnion2 [1,1,2,3,4] [2,3,5,5,6,7]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: cb464947-fb3e-46e0-8b0b-ba5fe5c94b62
: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Effective, but not so elegant, that trick of sticking in ~nub~ to
handle duplicates in the second list[fn:27].

Moving on, let's create a list of ~Color~ variables. But immediately
we will have a set-list paradigm clash if we create a list containing
"duplicates," e.g.,

#+name: 3406c128-f51e-459b-8f21-057f454bfbf8
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
myColors1 = [Red,Orange,Brown,Red]
#+end_src

~myColors1~, a bona fide Haskell list, is a /sequence/ with a second
~Red~ at the end. If ~myColors1~ were a math set, the second ~Red~
would simply be redundant.

*** Color comparisons

Let's repeat the definition here

#+name: 7e6eb6af-a15c-4adf-a222-698b65f81929
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data Color = Red | Yellow | Blue | Green | Purple | Orange | Brown deriving (Show,Eq,Enum)
#+end_src


The initial "math" we do on ~Color~ is contained in the
definition. Notice the ~deriving (Show,Eq)~~. These connect our
~Color~ type to the Haskell typeclasses ~Show~ and ~Eq~, creating a
default instances of ~Show Color~ and ~Eq Color~. Now, what would we
expect "equal-ness" to be in the case of ~Color~? Let's assume it
means ~Red == Red~, ~Yellow == Yellow~, etc. they evaluate to
~True~. Let's test

#+name: 75cfe732-4e2a-4cb3-b269-6c3df14f35ba
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
Red == Red
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 75cfe732-4e2a-4cb3-b269-6c3df14f35ba
: True

#+name: eb4a6ed2-582e-42db-96c1-9a9bf69142af
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: eb4a6ed2-582e-42db-96c1-9a9bf69142af

Purple == Red
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: f19c13b4-9940-4199-8e8c-57e50bdd2731
: False

It seems what Haskell thinks are equal colors is right. Let's take a
look under the hood

#+name: 66abbeec-f7c1-4156-ab03-f3949657ed97
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
:i Eq
#+end_src

  	-- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance [safe] Eq Color -- Defined at hroad4.hs:7:83
...
#+end_example

Yes, ~Color~ is now equipped with ~Eq~ typeclass methods ~(==)~ and
~(/=)~ for testing equality. ~==~ works. Let's try ~/=~

#+name: 351657e1-fc11-4f90-9fa8-0200eac7c8bf
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
Red /= Orange
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 351657e1-fc11-4f90-9fa8-0200eac7c8bf
: True

Can we add two ~Color~'s together? In art class what happens when we
"add" red and blue? We get purple. So yes, Haskell has a way to
establish addition, but to do this we'll need to take a rabbit hole
into higher math and establish just exactly what addition really
is. But first, we should explore what exactly we have with the type
~Color~ and why we created it as we did.

*** Haskell sum and product types

Many programming languages have types, but very few have true,
full-featured /algebraic data types/ (ADT)[fn:28]. In order to be a
proper ADT, we must be able to /compose/ new types, primarily by
combining other types.

At the most basic level we are 
Also, the two main sorts of counting, or
"enumerating sets," namely sums and products, 




Sum and product versus union and intersection.


This is possible and is provided for in Haskell with the typeclass
~Eq~, which establishes for various types "equal-ness."  Again,
Haskell, in its mathematical soul, doesn't take this for granted or
bury it in underlying code. One main reason is equality cannot simply
be assumed, e.g., there can be no (easy) idea of comparing functions
for equality[fn:29], even though functions in Haskell can become
arguments, as well as results of other functions.




** Subsets

The set $A$ is a /subset/ of the set $B$ if and only if

\begin{align}
\forall x\; (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B)
\end{align}

in effect says if all $x$'s in $A$ are also in $B\;$[fn:30], then $A$ is a
/subset/ of $B\;$, i.e., $A \subseteq B\;$. If simultaneously

\begin{align}
\forall x\; (x \in B \Rightarrow x \in A)
\end{align}

then $B \subseteq A\;$, hence, $A = B\;$. However, if (2) holds, but
not also (3) then $A \subset B\;$, i.e., $A$ is a /proper/ subset of
$B\;$, hence, $B$ has elements not in $A\;$.

Haskell-wise, a quick built-in (~Data.List~) function to check if a
list is a sublist of another list is ~isPrefixOf~[fn:31]

#+name: aa877bbb-b6b2-47f9-920e-cc9457644b09
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: aa877bbb-b6b2-47f9-920e-cc9457644b09
: True

The properties of /reflexivity/, /antisymmetry/, and /transitivity/
show up in set theory when we consider any /relations/[fn:32] the
elements might have amongst themselves. One common relation is to
simply pair elements together just like Cartesian coordinate pairs to
form a relation set.

*** Reflexivity

/Reflexivity/ is the general idea that some entity is equal to
itself. For a basic choose-two pairing relation, we might take a set
$A = \{1,2,3,4\}\;\;$ and create the pairing relation $R_1 =
\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)\}\;\;\;\;$. Here we have established a
/reflexive relation/, i.e., a relationship of each element with
itself.

This may seem trivial, but this idea of self-equaling can be
approached from surprisingly many vantage points. We can see
self-equaling reflexivity in

- /is equal to/, i.e., the basic idea that all the elements of a set
  are equal to themselves.
- /is a subset of/, i.e., a set is automatically a subset of itself.
- /divides/, i.e., the elements of a set can divide themselves to some
  unit value, e.g., $2/2 = 1\;$ since divisibility is $x / y\;$ such
  that there exists $z$ and $x \cdot z = y\;\;$.
- /is greater than or equal to/, i.e., technically we can say a set is
  greater than *or equal to* itself --- and just ignore the greater
  than part like a logical or does.
- /is less than or equal to/, i.e., again, we rely on the "or equal to."

In the diagram below

:RESOURCES:
- [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GreaterThanOrEqualTo.png][GreaterThanOrEqualTo]]
:END:

[[file:images/GreaterThanOrEqualTo.png]]

we have a set $B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}\;\;\;$ and then we create a
relation $x \ge y$ amongst the elements; $x$ is the first and $y$ the
second digit in the pair

\begin{align}
R_{x \ge y} = \{(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),\ldots,(8,1),(2,1),(3,2),\ldots,(8,2),(3,3),\ldots\}
\end{align}

We can reproduce this in Haskell with a quick list comprehension

#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(x,y) | y <- [1..8], x <- [1..8], x >= y]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 23c12b09-79f9-4e75-9cb6-ac581449ea40

What then would an /irreflexive/ relation on a set be? Basically any
relation, pairing that doesn't include an element-to-element pairing

- /is not equal to/, i.e., we consider all pairing /but/ same-equals-same.
- /is a proper subset of/, i.e., we create a set from another set that
  is not one-to-one equal element-wise.
- /is greater than/, i.e., we have a relation set just like (4) above,
  but we've left out $(1,1),(2,2)\ldots\;\;$ which makes it reflexive.

*** Symmetry and antisymmetry

A /symmetry/ relation $R$ on a set $A$ contains for every pair $(a,b)
\in R\;\;$ necessarily $(b,a) \in R\;\;$. /Antisymmetry/ means we have
$(a,b) \in R\;\;$ but then $(b,a) \notin R\;\;$.



/Antisymmetry/ in the context of sets and subsets formally establishes
the idea that

\begin{align}
A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A \Rightarrow A = B
\end{align}

We should probably start by saying what a /symmetric/ relation is. We
will soon establish what /relations/ are, but for now antisymmetry
means that an element of a set cannot have some connection with
another element, and that other element with the original element
unless they are equal, the same element. So with (4) we are in effect
lining up the elements of $A$ and $B$ and saying they are equal only
if their individual elements are matched one-to-one, equal-to-equal.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] ...or /set builder notation/.

[fn:2] More on the /universal set/ later.

[fn:3] Consider the man who obligated a wizard to tell him the secrets
of the universe. But in that same instant as the man knew the secrets
of the universe, the secrets changed and the secrets he knew were no
longer /the/ secrets of the universe, rather, common knowledge. The
man was angry with the wizard for cheating him, but the wizard argued
that they would not be the secrets of the universe if a mortal man
could actually know them.

[fn:4] We'll speak of how sets may be ordered later. But for now a
basic set is unordered.

[fn:5] Contrast sets with /sequences/ where order and repeating of
elements /do/ matter. Technically speaking, from the idea of a
/vector/, a /sequence/ is an @@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@
an ordered n-tuple $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in A^n\;\;$ of elements from $A$ for
some number $n\;$. @@html:</font>@@ and we'll get into what that
means later.

[fn:6] Why ~take~ stops ~[1,2..]~ from running wild has to do with
Haskell being a /lazy/ language, i.e., evaluation can be JIT (just in
time). Literally, when Haskell saw ~take~ it knew /not/ to let
~[1,2..]~ run forever. Neat trick.

[fn:7] Contrast with (1) above where *:* served as "such that" and $\varphi
()$ in the classic function form was used.

[fn:8] And yet another more intuitive way would be $\{x \;|\; x = a/b
\;\;\text{for some}\;\; a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\}\;\;$.

[fn:9] Once we have more Haskell prowess we will go into a detailed
version of math sets in Haskell...

[fn:10] Remember, Haskell /never/ alters a list; instead, it copies it,
works on the copy, then returns that worked-on copy. However, just
entering expressions at the ghci REPL, yes, you may create ~a =
[1,2,3]~ then /redefine/ ~a = [1,2,3,4]~ and the new value of ~a~ will
be ~[1,2,3,4]~. Likewise, you may redefine functions. However, this
redefining is just a convenience to you when working directly with
ghci command line. This will /not/ work in code in a file submitted to
ghc or ghci; instead, producing ~Multiple declarations of ‘a’~
error. In general, Haskell does not allow declaring a variable or
function symbol, then allow your program to reassign the symbol
somewhere else in the code.

[fn:11] As many as $O(n^2)\;$. More about /Big-O/ later.

[fn:12] ...tedious because numbers have /quantities/ built-in, i.e., we
can already see what's big, small, greater-than, equal, less-than.

[fn:13] We'll explain Haskell's take on a set of colors in just a
moment.

[fn:14] From logic this the /inclusive or/, like "I'll take strawberry
/or/ raspberry /or/ both," not the /exclusive or/ like "I will go to
his party /or/ her party, /not/ both".

[fn:15] ...if it's true that it's in $A$ and it's true that it's in
$B$, then it's in $A \lor B\;$; if it's true that it's in $A$ but not
true that it's in $B$ --- then it's still in $A \lor B\;$...

[fn:16] ...if it's in $A$ *and* it's in $B$, then it's in $A \land
B\;$. Otherwise, if it's not in $A$ or it's not in $B\;$, or it's
neither in $A$ nor in $B\;$, then it's not in $A \land B\;$.

[fn:17] Consider the /negate/ operator $\neg\;\;$. It is considered a
unary operator, i.e., it works on just one thing at a time. We can
also abstract /negate/ to mean, in general, an operator that sends
$x\;$ to $x'\;$ such that it can send it back, $x'\;$ to $x\;$,
again. In this broader sense, /negate/ flips a thing back and forth.

[fn:18] When we say something is /axiomatic/ we mean it is a system
based on axioms or ground rules, from which theorems are built.

[fn:19] Remember, we cannot allow $\mathbb{U}$ to include itself;
otherwise, Russell's Paradox comes back.

[fn:20] Happily, $x \leq x$ includes the possibility of $x = y\;$.

[fn:21] The /minuend/ (that which is subtracted from) and the
/subtrahend/ (that which is being subtracted away) are not
interchangeable, rather, subtraction depends on which is first and
second.

[fn:22] Just below we'll tackle when set operations and regular
numerical calculations coincide and when they don't.

[fn:23] Nomenclature: /Data constructors/ (or /value constructors/)
are on the right side of the equation of a type definition, while the
/type constructor/ is on the left side.

[fn:24] In algebra we might compare with $f(x) = c\;$, i.e., whatever
we put in for $x\;$, $f$ returns just $c\;$. We can also write $f() =
c\;$. Technically, a constant all by itself can be considered a
function or operation of /arity/ $0$. The /arity/ of a function or
operation is the number of arguments it takes.

[fn:25] Yes, they act like functions, but not in the regular sense of
a normal function taking input and producing output. A type or data
constructor is taking input and creating our data type environment.

[fn:26] A basic definition of a Haskell /sum type/ is a data type that
allows us to express alternative possibilities with just one data
type.

[fn:27] Truth will out, the Haskell ~Data.List.union~ function doesn't
properly handle duplicates in the first list. Bug or feature? Happy
ending: ~Data.Set.union~ works properly.

[fn:28] The main languages with true ADT are of the "ML Family," i.e.,
SML, Ocaml, F#, and Haskell.

[fn:29] ... although the concept of "do these two different looking
functions give us the same results?" is very big in the world of
comp-sci.

[fn:30] ... all /elements/ of $A$ are also /elements/ of $B\;$.

[fn:31] ~isInfixOf~ has cousins ~isPrefixOf~ and ~isSuffixOf~ which
respectively check if a list starts or ends another list.

[fn:32] We'll dive into /relations/ soon. For now just use an intuitive
idea.

[fn:34] Combining numbers with addition makes sense, whereas division
~(/)~ not really, especially since division can produce outcomes not
~Integer~.

[fn:33] ~mconcat~ uses a ~foldr~ since ~foldl~ breaks down with
infinite lists since it forces evaluations at each step, which can get
costly.

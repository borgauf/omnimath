Back at the library study room they've checked out the reserved books
and are looking through sections of those that deal with the basic
theory of division.

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [reading from the
Divisibility section of /Proofs, A Long-Form Mathematical

understand divisibility before we go to /greatest common divisor/, and
before we talk about primes. She said, You have to know all of the
implications of "divided by" before you can advance. And like it's
saying in here, [reading] you could just say, $a$ divides $b$ if
$\frac{a}{b}$ produces an integer. \\
[Ursula and Uwe read the section from a second copy] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] But
we don't want that definition, we want /this/ definition [writing on
the board]

\begin{align}
\exists \: k \in \mathbb{Z},\; a \neq 0, \;\;a \mid b \;\; \text{if} \;\; b = a \cdot k  
\end{align}

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing] The
symbol $a \mid b\:$ means $a$ divides $b$ for some $k$ where $b = a \cdot
k\;$ and $a$ is not equal to zero. [pausing] Right, all that makes
sense. So basically, this turns the whole question of divisibility
into finding a proper integer value for $k\:$ to /multiply/ with. Now
we have a mathy formalist way of seeing divisibility. \\
[murmurs of approval] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ I like how he says
good definitions don't just fall out of the sky. \\

words we've found a whole number integer, $k = 7$, and we're happy. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Again, we've
turned division into an issue of true-false logic and
multiplication. [writing on the board] So $7 \mid 23$ doesn't work
because we have no solution for $7 \cdot k = 23$. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ And look at that
last one where it's $a \mid 0\;$. That's true, for a non-zero $a$

[murmurs of agreement] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ So for [writing
on the board] $a \mid b$, we can say $a$ is a /divisor/ of $b$, and

[murmurs of agreement] \\

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Good, now he's
talking about the /transitive/ property of divisibility. It is a
/proposition/, which is a type of theorem, and that means it comes
with a proof. [writing on the board] Here it is in the compact math
logic form

$a \mid c$ part is true. So [writing]

$-1\:$ like you did. So $k$ must be negative to go with the $-a\:$,

$k$ being an integer allows this. But again, we're dealing with a

0\:$, that zero divides zero, is true --- because [writing on board]
$0 = 0 \cdot k\:$, meaning $k$ can be anything and the expression remains
true. [reading further] And he's calling $k$ the /accessory
number/. [reading further] So his wording is the integers $x$ that
satisfy $7 \mid x$ are $x = 7 \cdot k$ --- and that will be the arithmetic
progression of the multiples of $7\:$. They're evenly

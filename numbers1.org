* Thursday at the library

It's Thursday afternoon and the von der Surwitz siblings meet in their
reserved study room at the main university library to go over
Wednesday's lecture and examples. After Wednesday's class, they're
glad they and the other ItCS participants had met with Professor
Chandra at the Novalis Tech Open House two weeks prior to the start of
school and had gotten a heads-up on what was ahead, including her
repository. As a result they all had gone down the minimal
prerequisite rabbit holes and were more or less ready.

Ursula von der Surwitz has plugged in her laptop to the big monitor
and is scrolling through Professor Chandra's first substantive lecture
on Wednesday of the first week of classes[fn:1].

⌜...\\
For most of us our first experience with the abstraction power of
numbers begins when our parents teach us to hold up three fingers to
show everyone we're three years old. And so we were introduced to the
idea of seeing an abstract numerical magnitude such as the number
three as a mapping or connection of three fingers to three years of
life.

Then at some point we learn what mathematician Eugenia Cheng[fn:2]
calls the "counting poem," i.e., we learn how to count from one to
ten, usually on our fingers. And about this time we learn to negotiate
numerically, like when we said, /I'll give so many of these if you
give me so many of that/. But then begins formal school math, and each
year math becomes progressively less interesting, less popular --- to
the point of being a hated subject. This in my opinion is due to the
curriculum being based on conditioned learning, the /when you see
this, do this/ method ... unfortunately.

But if you major in math in college you eventually start to see in the
later years[fn:3] --- after the four Freshman and Sophomore semesters
of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra --- what is
commonly called "higher math."  And these upper-semester math courses
can be a complete reboot of math, weeding out vague, ad hoc,
/parochial/[fn:4] notions, replacing them with a rigorous,
theoretical, formalistic, foundational understanding of math. As
mathematician Joe Fields says, this is when you stop being a "see
this, do this" calculator and become a prover, i.e., a deeper thinker
about math.

/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][Set theory]]/ is a big part of this formalism[fn:5]. Set theory is an
exacting, don't-take-stuff-for-granted world, which turns out to be
good for the computer world as well since computer circuits don't
attend human grade school, don't learn poems, and don't have
fingers[fn:6]. Again, if you want a computer to understand something,
you have to spell it out in very precise and exacting ways. That is to
say, you're always facing /logical entailment/ (LE) with computers. So
how then /does/ a computer understand numbers? And isn't a computer
doing numbers the same way a clock does time? Think about it. Does a
ticking clock that you have to wind up have any real concept of time?
No, it doesn't.

One fascinating twist of mathematical history is how, on the whole,
the Greeks seemed to favor geometry over numbers. Their mastery of
geometry really got going with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements][Euclid's Elements]] ca. 300 BC, which
starts with just a point and a line and from there builds up expansive
theorems about complex geometric shapes, i.e., no numbers[fn:7]. Even
when Euclid's geometry worked with the concepts of length and angles,
no numbers were employed[fn:8]. And as the physicist Julian Barbour
said, A triangle is known for its shape not its size.

This week we'll talk about numbers in a fairly theoretical but not
really difficult manner. Along with the math, we'll do some work with
Haskell that you should be ready for[fn:9]. \\

  $\frac{a}{b}\;$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b$ cannot be
  $0\;$ --- although this is really too simple and we'll be expanding
  on it later.
+ $\mathbb{R}\;$: the /real/ numbers are the limit of a convergent
  sequence of rational numbers... Really? Yes, but this is a higher
  math sort of definition. Suffice it to say for now reals are the
  rational numbers (including recurring decimals) along with
  *ir*-rational numbers (non-recurring decimals), e.g., the square
  root of $2\;$. In other words, numbers that are expressed with
  decimals[fn:10]. /Lots/ more to come...
+ $\mathbb{C}\;$: the /complex/ numbers are of the form $a + bi\;$

  $-1\;$. Again, lots more later.

* The qualities of quantity

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ [scrolling] So
here's more.

⌜... \\
A number is a concept, first and foremost a symbol related to
/quantity/ and /magnitude/. And as such a number has great powers of
abstraction. Numbers may be applied in the abstraction exercises of
counting or enumerating, as well as measuring things[fn:12].

<span class="cap">The concept, the embodiment of three and "three-ness"</span>
#+end_export

Consider these /qualities/ of quantities

- cardinality, or /how many?/
- ordinality, or /what order?/
- enumeration, or, generally, /how do we count out things?/

As we've said, when we bring the computer into this quantification
game, we cannot assume these basic qualities as given[fn:13]. \\
...⌟

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ [continuing]
Any thoughts, questions? \\
[all study the screen] \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔱𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ Let's go on.

** Cardinality

⌜... \\
In everyday language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_numeral][cardinal numbers]] are simply the counting numbers,
$\mathbb{N}\;$, either as words or numerical symbols. In set theory,
however, /cardinality/ has a different meaning, i.e., /the number the
objects in a set/. So if we consider the box of stars in the diagram
above to be a /set/ of stars, then the cardinality of this set is $3$
since there are three stars[fn:14]

\begin{align*}
|\,S_{stars} \,| &= 3 \\
|\,\{a, b, c\}\,| &= 3 \\
|\,\mathbb{N}\,| &= \infty \\
|\,\mathbb{Z}\,| &= \infty
\end{align*}

But why are we being so "conceptual" about the simple idea of amount,
and why must we give it a fancy name? Again, math likes to /formalize/
things, nail things down. Starting with exactness and precision we can
then build very complex and logically-based math[fn:15]. Now, if two
sets have the same cardinality, is this somehow significant? Above, we
see that both the set of natural numbers and the set of integers have
infinity as their cardinality. Are, therefore, $\mathbb{N}$ and
$\mathbb{Z}$ the same "size?"

@@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@The /bijection principle/ states that
two sets have the same size /if and only if/ there is a /bijection/
(injective /and/ surjective together) between
them@@html:</font>@@[fn:16].

Which means $|\,S_{stars} \,|\;$ and $|\,\{a, b, c\}\,|\;$ can be matched
up one-to-one, thus, they must have the same cardinality. But again,
what about sets of things that supposedly have an infinite size? How
do we "count," or "pair up" infinite sets[fn:17]?  Surprisingly, there
are different kinds of infinity --- which necessitates this exactness
and preciseness. More about cardinality theory later. \\
...⌟

@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔴𝔢:@@html:</span>@@ So basically,
cardinality is a formalism from set theory about amount and
magnatude. Fair enough. \\
@@html:<span class="fraktur">@@𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:@@html:</span>@@ What about this
section? [scrolling]

*** Haskell and cardinality

⌜... \\
The first thing to know about Haskell and set theory is, yes, we can
do real set theory with Haskell's ~Data.Set~ package. But as beginners
learning the ropes we will start with a simpler representation of sets
through Haskell's basic /list/ data structure. Realize, however, that
a list is not a set; they are two different beasts, and we'll have to
account for that. For one, a set may have duplicates, whereas a list
holds a definite /sequence/ of things, i.e., every element of the list
is unique, even if some elements are repeated[fn:18]. So the /set/
$\{1,2,1\}\;$ is the same as $\{1,2\}\;$ is the same as $\{2,1,1\}\;$
because sets don't mind duplicates, nor do they worry about
order[fn:19]. But the /lists/ ~[1,2,1]~, ~[1,2]~, and ~[2,1,1]~ are in
fact all different lists. Initially, we'll practice set theory with
lists and build alternate set theory code based on lists. Then when we
understand "squirrel math" a little more, i.e., how to work with the
data structures known as /trees/, we'll do proper set theory with
Haskell's set theory module, [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.6/docs/Data-Set.html][Data.Set]][fn:20].  For the immediate
future we'll consider a list to be a beginner's substitute for a
set. And so a simple "how many" function on a list standing in for a
set is /length/

you have the word /or/ to mean that we don't keep picking up the same

them. So I definitely see your point, the set notation /doesn't/ tell
us not to include duplicates --- without some /exclusive/ sort of
/inclusive or/. Only the Venn diagram really shows us this. I mean,
the whole point of this is to think about whether the definition of
set union rules out duplicates, doesn't worry about order, and has
commutativity. I don't see that \\

** Ordinality

⌜... \\
In everyday language the concept of order is conveyed when we say
/first, second, third, fourth,/ etc[fn:22]. And we're done, right? But
again, as seen from set theory --- as well as from the computer world
--- (re-)establishing order is important and cannot always be taken
for granted. In fact, a great deal of investigation surrounds
ordinality.

The counting numbers, the set $\mathbb{N}\;$, would seem to have order
built in. For example, everybody knows that $3$ comes after $2\;$
etc., they're in ascending order based on the incrementally greater
amounts they represent. And neither does the set $\mathbb{N}\;$ have
repeats. Also, if we create a geometric visual for $\mathbb{N}\;$,
that is to say, we draw a line and mark places on the line for each
number, we can subdivide the line into /intervals/[fn:23] and order is
related to inequalities.

But order, and all it's implications, is not always a given
in real life. What if we wrote the numbers from one to ten on small
squares of paper, put them in a box, and then shook them out on the
floor in a straight line?  Would they be in order? Chances are,
no. And what about sets of things that aren't inherently numerical,
such as colors?

So if we don't have things in proper order---which is often the case
in the real world---we have to put things in order ourselves. And that
means we will need to /sort/ a set of unsorted elements into some
order. Sorting, in fact, is one of the more basic tasks computers do
in the everyday world[fn:24].

But to sort we need to compare things. Obviously, ten whole numbers
written clearly on ten squares of paper can be easily sorted by
hand[fn:25]. But what if we had thousands of squares of paper, each
with a unique number? Then we'd have a long task ahead of us. But no
matter how big or small the task, we would compare /two/ numbers at a
time and then make a judgement based on whether one number was

- greater than
- equal to
- less than

the other number, then rearranging as needed. \\
...⌟






*** Ordinality in Haskell

Haskell is a typed language with a feature called /type
classes/[fn:26]. A Haskell type class encompasses traits, patterns,
concepts, or what we might call a certain "-ness" that can be imparted
to data types. In Haskell, for example, numbers and the characters of
the alphabet can be directly compared for "equal-ness," and when we
test at the ghci REPL prompt, this seems to be built-in

#+name: 6907ee9d-2eff-4263-a232-1ef2d3f1d546
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
((5 == 3) || ('a' == 'a')) || ('b' == 'B')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 6907ee9d-2eff-4263-a232-1ef2d3f1d546
: True

Mindful of LE, we see that Haskell's ~Eq~ class
housing this equal-ness must have some sort of behind-the-scenes
mechanism that allows us to take two things, analyze them, then return
a decision, true or false (yes they are equal, no they're not equal),
on whether two said things were equal or not --- all of this just for
doing some typing, e.g., ~5 == 3~ into the REPL.

Something else to consider is how some things don't necessarily have
the concept of equal or not equal straight out of the box. What if we
created a data type for colors and we wanted to compare the individual
color values for equal-ness? Intuitively, we might say red, yellow,
and blue are equal since they are all primary colors; likewise,
orange, green, and violet are equal because they're the secondary
colors. But what if we just say each color is equal to itself and not
equal to any of the others? ... So how would we establish equal-ness
for colors? If we want to type ~Green == Blue~ into the REPL it's up
to us to have created some sort of equal-ness and told Haskell about
it.

Data types that need to establish equal-ness for themselves can apply
to the Haskell ~Eq~ type class for membership. Type class membership
is registered with an /instance/ statement. To see all the data types
that have an instance registered with ~Eq~ we can use ~:info~
(abbreviated ~:i~) at the REPL[fn:27]

#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
:i Eq
#+end_src

#+begin_example
type Eq :: * -> Constraint
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  {-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
...
instance Eq Int -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Float -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Double -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Char -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Bool -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
...
#+end_example

which gives us a long list (abbreviated above) of data types that have
equal-ness defined[fn:28]. Notice the two "prescribed" methods (functions)
~(==)~ and ~(/=)~. These functions are the mechanism used by ~Eq~ to
establish equal-ness. They must be custom defined in each instance
declaration in order for a data type to have its own established
equal-ness[fn:29]. And so if you create a new type, you, the
programmer, must come up with your own version of these two functions,
~(==)~ and ~(/=)~ to establish the trait, the property of equal-ness
for that new data type. As /LYAHFGG/ notes, the type signature for the
equal-ness function ~(==)~ is[fn:30]

#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
:t (==)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 02cab397-30df-497e-9972-b743c08f71d4
: (==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool

which indicates ~(==)~ takes two inputs of some type ~a~ and returns a
~Bool~ type, i.e., either ~True~ or ~False~. Good, we saw how that
works with our examples above. But there's another wrinkle to this
story. So if ~(==)~ is a function that takes two objects of type ~a~,
e.g., two integers, real numbers, characters, booleans, etc., how can
we use this same symbol ~(==)~ in so many different contexts?  Looking
above, how did Haskell know to use /integer/ equal-ness rules (defined
by ~instance Eq Int~) when comparing integers, and then /letter/
equal-ness rules (defined by ~instance Eq Char~) when comparing
letters? This feat is what we call /ad hoc polymorphism/[fn:31], which
allows just a single function symbol, e.g., ~(==)~, to be used
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading][overloaded]]) in many different contexts. And so Haskell figures out
behind the scenes which instance to apply. Neat.

Let's take a closer look at a color type by defining our own[fn:32] [fn:33]

#+name: 754b208f-cd5e-4c08-b844-6bb7eaa7cfd6
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data Color = Red | Yellow | Blue | Green deriving (Show,Read)
#+end_src

Obviously, the colors red, yellow, blue, and green have no intrinsic
numerical properties by which to compare one with the other. However,
Haskell's type class system still allows us to create some manner of
equal-ness for it. And so we write this version of an /instance/ of
~Eq~ for ~Color~

#+name: 589c20e0-2d24-4e7e-b360-83cd98556379
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
instance Eq Color where
  Red == Red = True      -- could also be (==) Red Red = True
  Yellow == Yellow = True
  Blue == Blue = True
  Green == Green = True
  _ == _ = False         -- anything getting to this point must be false
#+end_src

And so we've hand-coded our own equal-ness for ~Color~ by spelling out
how ~(==)~ works for ~Color~. This literally tells Haskell what
~Color~ equal-ness should be by customizing how the function ~(==)~
should work. Let's have another look at the type signature for ~(==)~

#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
:t (==)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 02cab397-30df-497e-9972-b743c08f71d4
: (==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool

As LYAHFGG notes, the ~Eq a~ part is known as a /class
constraint/. This means whatever ~a~ might be[fn:34], it must have an
equal-ness instance already registered for it --- which we do ---
otherwise, Haskell won't know how to compare two things of ~a~ for
equal-ness[fn:35].

#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
(Red == Red) && (Red /= Green)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True

Good, it's working and we now can compare ~Color~ values for
equal-ness, but how do we /order/ colors? No matter how we establish
one color before the other, it might seem arbitrary, but we can do it
if we want. For basic order-ness Haskell has the type class ~Ord~ to
which types can register

#+name: d48de71a-00aa-4e66-8c0e-ae0b782617a1
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: d48de71a-00aa-4e66-8c0e-ae0b782617a1
#+begin_example
type Ord :: * -> Constraint
class Eq a => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  max :: a -> a -> a
  min :: a -> a -> a
  {-# MINIMAL compare | (<=) #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
...
instance Ord Ordering -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’

instance Ord Char -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Ord Bool -- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Classes’
instance Ord Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num.Integer’
...
#+end_example

Note how the ~Ord~ declaration itself has a class constraint, i.e.,
~Eq a =>~. This means any data type ~a~ must already have its ~Eq~
instance registered. Hence, ~Eq~ is a sort of super-class, and yes,
type classes can build hierarchies of themselves.

Again, we see ~Ord~ has a minimum requirement for order-ness, namely,
that we define the method[fn:36] (function) ~compare~ ... and then we
get all the other order-ness methods, ~(<)~ ... ~min~ for free, as in
Haskell is smart enough to figure them out just based on what you gave
for ~compare~. Neat[fn:37].

#+name: 2aed084d-1010-4157-ab01-19568c0c3ed0

#+RESULTS: 2aed084d-1010-4157-ab01-19568c0c3ed0
: compare :: Ord a => a -> a -> Ordering

The function ~compare~ is, like ~(==)~, a binary (two inputs)
operation that takes inputs of the same data type ~a~ and returns
something of type ~Ordering~. So what is ~Ordering~? Let's ask

#+name: 1f465fe8-db42-4be5-839d-859869a51945
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
:i Ordering
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 1f465fe8-db42-4be5-839d-859869a51945
#+begin_example
type Ordering :: *
data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
  	-- Defined in ‘ghc-prim-0.7.0:GHC.Types’

instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
instance Read Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Read’
instance Bounded Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Enum’
#+end_example

There's a lot of information here. Note the data type declaration for
~Ordering~ is

#+begin_example
...
data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
...
#+end_example

While the type ~Bool~ had two /data constructors/ ~True~ and ~False~,
~Ordering~ has three --- ~LT~, ~EQ~, and ~GT~. Now, let's write code
to register an instance of ~Ord~ for ~Color~[fn:38]

#+name: 5d492aee-6cdc-41a7-a524-3c4d275d5b1a
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
instance Ord Color where
  compare Red Red = EQ
  compare Red _ = GT
  compare _ Red = LT
  compare Yellow Yellow = EQ
  compare Yellow _ = GT
  compare _ Yellow = LT
  compare Blue Blue = EQ
  compare Blue _ = GT
  compare _ Blue = LT
  compare Green Green = EQ
#+end_src

Again, the ~Ord~ type class required us to create our own ~compare~
method, which painstakingly we did. Now we can compare two values
of ~Color~ for order-ness with our basic ~Ord~ comparison operators[fn:39],
~>~, ~<~, and ~==~,

#+name: 83d91b48-8ad6-4a74-99df-cab48cb30619
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
((Blue < Green) || (Red == Red)) && (Yellow >= Blue)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: fbbbf176-9745-4672-a381-6748475751c3
: True

Now, how many possible combinations of these four colors would we have
to make in order to test /all possible cases/? This is a topic the
basics of which we'll explore later. But here's a taste of these
future endeavors. Perhaps you noticed in LYAHFGG the talk about /[[http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#im-a-list-comprehension][list
comprehensions]]/. These mimic /set comprehensions/ fairly closely

\begin{align*}
& C = \{Red,Yellow,Blue,Green \} \\
& \{(x,y) \;|\; x \in C, \;y \in C \}
\end{align*}

And in Haskell

#+name: 0c6adf70-d05f-4e18-aed8-bbc378ff6985
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
cset = [Red,Yellow,Blue,Green]

Let's define another color type and simply rely on Haskell's
~deriving~ to create instances for ~Eq~ and ~Ord~ 

#+name: 788971a7-f080-4823-8779-161d0eb9d072
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data Color2 = Green2 | Blue2 | Yellow2 | Red2 deriving (Show,Read,Eq,Ord)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 6a445e0d-565a-4622-849b-515a1a415f3d
: False

For equal-ness ~deriving~ simply made everything equal to itself and
not equal to other colors---just like we did before by hand. Then for
order-ness ~deriving~ simply took the ~Color2~ data constructors in
the order they were declared and ranked them in ascending order

#+name: 1156d835-02cd-4fdf-a13e-04522a91eb4f
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 1156d835-02cd-4fdf-a13e-04522a91eb4f
: True

**** Types of types

We should explain one more thing at this point, namely, what that
first line of our ~:i~ readouts says

#+name: 2755e44f-a219-41c2-9863-9bed71b85971
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
:i Color
#+end_src

#+begin_example
: type Color :: *
: data Color = Red | Yellow | Blue | Green
:   	-- Defined at omni1.1.hs:29:1
: instance [safe] Eq Color -- Defined at omni1.1.hs:30:10
: instance [safe] Ord Color -- Defined at omni1.1.hs:36:10
: instance [safe] Read Color -- Defined at omni1.1.hs:29:57
: instance [safe] Show Color -- Defined at omni1.1.hs:29:52
#+end_example

~type Color :: *~ is telling us that the /type/ of the type ~Color~ is
~*~. Huh? So if the type of values ~Red~ or ~Green~ is ~Color~, the
/type/ of ~Color~ is it's /kind/, here expressed by the symbol
~*~. @@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@ ~Color~ has kind ~*~, which
says ~Color~ is a type constructor of *arity* null, or a /nullary/
type constructor.@@html:</font>@@ So what does this mean? Let's take
it apart...

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity][Arity]] is something functions have. $f(x) = x^2\;$ has an arity of one
since it takes just the one parameter, $x$. For $f(x,y) = x^2y^{1/3\;\;}$
arity is two --- and we usually say /binary/ since it takes two
parameters, $x$ and $y\;$. But $f() = 5\;$ is a function that takes no
parameters and always returns $5\;$. It's arity is null[fn:40].

In the second line, the data type declaration line, we see the left
side of the ~=~ is ~Color~, which is the /type constructor/, and on
the right side are the /data constructors/ or /value constructors/,
which are ~Red | Yellow | Blue | Green~, which are also referred to as
just the /values/ of ~Color~. Again, the type of ~Red~ is ~Color~, and
the type of ~Color~ is ~*~, which is Haskell's way of noting ~Color~
has an arity of null. Which is just like $f() = 5\;$ only that it has
values[fn:41] ~Red~, ~Yellow~, ~Blue~, *or* ~Green~ as possible values
instead of just $5$. And like $5$, we can consider them as
constants. Yes, it might be odd to consider a data type as a sort of
function taking parameters, but under Haskell's hood they do. So we
might say ~Color~ takes the null parameter and returns one of its
color data constructors as a value. Odd, but that's Haskell.

So what would be an example of type with higher arity? What would a
data type look like that had a type constructor on the left side of
~=~ that did in fact take input like a function --- and what does such
a thing give us?  Consider this data type

#+name: 73697dca-5548-4332-b672-1e8efafb0865
#+begin_src haskell :eval never :exports code
data StreetShops a = Grant a | Lee a | Lincoln a deriving (Show,Read)
#+end_src

And its kind will look like this

#+name: 46093ee6-7475-4d4c-84d2-fe0ba46f4c8b
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
:k StreetShops
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 46093ee6-7475-4d4c-84d2-fe0ba46f4c8b
: StreetShops :: * -> *

The form ~* -> *~ is Haskell's way of saying the data type
~StreetShops~ indeed takes a single parameter like a function. And
that parameter ~a~ is, like before, leveraging parametric
polymorphism, meaning ~a~ can be any data type. This in turn makes
~StreetShops~ polymorphic, i.e., its values ~Grant~, ~Lee~, and
~Lincoln~ are able to take input of different data types. For example,
if we want our ~StreetShops~ value ~Grant~ to represent a list of all
the shops we visit on Grant Street[fn:42]

#+name: 2837bab8-8318-4e59-8833-96ac4fb4438d

:t shopsOnGrant
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: 5b154686-a9e8-4198-bed0-51e6ea7aa1c9
: shopsOnGrant :: StreetShops [String]

So each of the data constructors can take a parameter ~a~, which can
be anything. If we want a ~StreetShops~ value to hold the average
number of visitors per day[fn:43]

#+name: 4b652b3d-f3bc-4d2f-858e-39007723ced9

: visitorsOnGrant :: Num a => StreetShops a

Again, ~StreetShops~, by having kind or arity of one, is polymorphic
in its one parameter ~a~.  And in reality there is no /just/
~StreetShops~ type; instead, ~StreetShops~ has to be teamed up with
another type to be used. To be sure, ~StreetShops~ is a contrived
example of the ~* -> *~ kind. In reality there are probably better
ways of managing data about streets. But we'll certainly use lots of
data types with higher arity, especially when we start going deeper
into some of the more math-derived features in Haskell. And so that's
why we wanted to introduce what may seem pretty abstract at this
point[fn:44].

**** The ~Num~ super class

Did you notice that ~Num a =>~ class constraint in the type details of
~visitorsOnGrant~? When we created the variable ~visitorsOnGrant~ we
gave the value constructor ~Grant~ a number --- but we didn't say what
sort of number, ~Int~, ~Integer~, ~Float~... Haskell then inferred
that it was something numerical and constrained it with the type class
~Num~...

Let's take another look at the concept of class hierarchy. Remember
how we had ~Eq~ equal-ness as a prerequisite for ~Ord~ order-ness? We
needed equal-ness to then create order-ness. Consider this

: 1 :: Num p => p

This is Haskell's way of saying, Yes, this is some sort of /literal/
number you gave me. And all I can say back to you is it is a
number. And so the generic parameter ~p~ has the class constraint that
whatever ~p~ may be (here we provided ~1~), it must be registered with
the type class ~Num~. So what is this ~Num~ class?

Here we see number-ness defined through its methods. Whatever type
might want to be considered a number will need to have these
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, negation, etc.,
i.e., register an instance with the ~Num~ class[fn:45].

Actually, ~Num~ is a great place to start really seeing how
mathematical Haskell is. ~:i Num~ gives us good look, but, as we
mentioned before, [[https://hackage.haskell.org/][hackage.haskell.org]], in this case [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/GHC-Num.html][GHC.Num]].

What is this? Why is this mentioned? A simple starter explanation is
that we have here a set of guidelines for how addition and
multiplication must behave in order to have an instance of
~Num~. Let's continue...

So if multiplication is just a glorified sort of addition, and
division is glorified subtraction[fn:46], then that makes addition and
subtraction the basis of arithmetic, /but/ they have a very
fundamentally different behavior when used in the wild that we must,
in turn, account for. Yes, addition puts things together and
subtraction takes something away from another thing. But there's
further /-ness/ to addition that subtraction doesn't have, namely,
/order doesn't seem to matter, whereas it does with subtraction (and
of course division)/. Obviously it matters which number gets
subtracted or divided by which, but not with addition and
multiplication.

We mentioned /binary/ operators before, which means whenever we add or
subtract we're really taking just two numbers at a time[fn:47], i.e.,
the arity of the ~(+)~ operator is two, or ~(+)~ is a /binary/
operation. But again, why are we concerned with this?

Notice at [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/GHC-Num.html][GHC.Num]] it says

#+begin_quote
The Haskell Report defines no laws for ~Num~. However, (+) and (*) are
customarily expected to define a ring and ...
#+end_quote

The Haskell Report is a reference manual for how Haskell is put
together, often just showing us how certain pieces of the language are
coded under the hood. Typically, you see a Backus-Naur
description[fn:48], then some description/talk, maybe also examples
and "translations[fn:49]."  GHC.Num says there is no particular
mention in the HR of these arithmetical laws, but ~(+)~ and ~(*)~
should /define a ring/. So here the lore is getting deep. What is
meant by a /ring/[fn:50]? Well, a ring is something from abstract
algebra, which you'll see in a mathematics curriculum once you're
beyond Frosh college math including calculus, differential equations,
and linear algebra. The basic idea is that a ring is a /set/
containing a /set/ of numbers, along with key arithmetical operators
behaving in certain ways. In other words, a ring is a sort of like a
package which includes numbers and the operations that work on those
numbers[fn:51]. Then neatly bundled like this, we can do and say things about
them as a whole. But let's leave it at that for now. We'll soon
explore other similar "packagings" (semigroups, monoids, etc.) from
abstract algebra that are brought over for use in Haskell.

Continuing, if the so-called /fundamental laws of arithmetic/[fn:52] say

1. $a + b = b + a\quad$ (additive commutativity, AC)
2. $ab = bc\quad$ (multiplicative commutativity, MC)
3. $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\quad$ (additive associativity, AA)
4. $a(bc) = (ab)c\quad$ (multiplicative associativity, MA)
5. $a(b + c) = ab + ac\quad$ (distributive law, DL)

then in order to have "number-ness" a ~Num~ instance for a number type
should have these behaviors when added or multiplied. But if we
compare, these /five/ laws concerning addition and multiplication
aren't exactly the same as those Haskell laws mentioned above from
GHC.Num. For one, Where's #2, multiplicative commutativity, i.e., $ab
= bc\;$? It turns out not everything has MC; hence, we don't want to
be obligated to defining MC for everything. An example is when
multiplying matrices. Maybe we're not that far, but no, matrix
multiplication does not guarantee $ab = bc\;$. Another potential
divergence is /additive inverse/ and /multiplicative inverse/. These
should be defined on any type wanting to join the ~Num~ class. More on
that later.

$\mathfrak{Fazit}\;$: ~Num~ is a super-class that is a prerequisite
"constraint" for anything number-like in Haskell. And so any type with
which we want to do basic arithmetic, i.e., to have number-ness, must
register an instance with the type class ~Num~, defining the minimum
set of methods in order to perform basic math operations.


This has been a brief, hurried introduction to ordinality --- with a
small detour to explore some of the LE of what numbers are vis-à-vis
Haskell and computers. The notion of order is everywhere and cannot be
taken for granted. And the idea of ordinality goes pretty deep in
higher math. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_field][this]] and [[https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analysis/Introduction_to_Mathematical_Analysis_I_(Lafferriere_Lafferriere_and_Nguyen)/01%3A_Tools_for_Analysis/1.04%3A_Ordered_Field_Axioms][this]] fire hose treatments as somewhere
between R_{O} and R_{FYI}. (And see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#Von_Neumann_definition_of_ordinals][this]] for something we'll eventually take
a Haskell stab at.) Note especially the /order axioms/ and the
/properties of ordered fields/. In general, these treatments are
upper-level/grad math --- or, yes, upper-level comp-sci, depending on
your future school's program. Remember, comp-sci dips and weaves
around and through higher math with little or no warning --- a bit
like physics routinely takes off into high math-land as well.

interesting aspect of this book is her treatment of /category theory/,
which is a superset of type theory, much of which is baked into
Haskell.

one of the first three rabbit holes in the math section.

[fn:6] If machines were capable of conditioned learning, your car
should be able to self-drive certain oft-travelled routes, e.g., from
your home to the grocery store.

[fn:7] It was a long-revered feat of logical minimalism that all
two-dimensional shapes in /Elements/ could be produced with just a
compass and a straightedge. Follow the Wikipedia link and note the
animation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements#/media/File:HexagonConstructionAni.gif][the construction of a hexagon]]. It wasn't until the
development of calculus and infinitesimal methods in the Renaissance
that this compass-and-stick purity was set aside.

[fn:8] Later we'll explore how Descartes united algebra and geometry.

[fn:9] Make sure you're getting along with the Haskell rabbit hole materials --- at
the very least worked through half of LYAHFFG.

[fn:10] Two questions: Are repeating decimal numbers also rational? If
yes, then why can't rational numbers represent all numbers? That is,
why do we need real and complex numbers? Programming challenge: Write
a function that takes a real decimal number and figures out its
fraction, e.g. $3.14$ is $157/50\:$. Does Haskell have a built-in way
to do this? Hint: Check out [[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Convert_decimal_number_to_rational#Haskell][Convert decimal number to rational]]. Maybe
compare with how Julia and Racket do it.

[fn:11] Professor Chandra connected this to Haskell by mentioning
Haskell's "point-free" programming ... but didn't elaborate.

[fn:12] But then measuring must be "quantified" by counting unit-wise
what was measured; hence, everything comes back to counting. This will
come up when we explore real numbers versus rational numbers.

[fn:13] Inside your head you automatically know how many and in what
order the numbers $1$ through $10$ are. However, a computer must be
taught such basic quantitative qualities.

[fn:14] We indicate the set's cardinality by surrounding the symbol for
a set with /pipes/ ( **|** ), e.g., $|S_{stars}|\;$. This is not the same
as /absolute value/, although they might be cousins.

[fn:15] Have a look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality][this Wikipedia discussion of cardinality]]. Later
we will look into /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number][cardinal numbers]]/, which is a deeper dive into set
theory.

[fn:16] We'll look at injective, surjective, and bijective when we
delve into functions from a set theory perspective. Also, mathematical
logic will introduce us to /if and only if/.

[fn:17] To excite your curiosity, isn't $\infty + 1$ still just $\infty\;$? The
Greeks contemplated this and concluded that infinity has the power to
consume, destroy individual numbers. It wasn't until the German
mathematician Georg Cantor came along in the late nineteenth century
that we learned to wrangle infinity.

[fn:18] So it's not really a "grocery list," it's a "grocery set"
since $\{eggs,sugar,coffee,eggs\}\;\;\;$ is invariably interpreted as
just $\{eggs,sugar,coffee\}\;\;$, right? Or would you go ahead and get
eggs twice? Can you come up with another real-world example where a
set of things doesn't care about order or duplicates?

[fn:19] Why is this? There is a LE to the definition
of a set union, namely, $A \cup B = \{x \;\;|\;\; x \in A \;\;\;or\;\;\; x \in
B \}\quad$. Consider the sets $A = \{1,2,3\}\;$, $B = \{2,3,4\}\;$,
and $C = \{3,4,5\}\;$. If you draw out Their union $A \cup B \cup C = \{x
\;|\; x \in A \;\;\text{or}\;\;x \in B\;\; \text{or}\;\;x \in C \}\quad\;\;$ as
a Venn diagram, you'll see how duplicates get left out.

[fn:20] Take a look at this Hackage page. It has [[https://haskell-containers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/set.html][an intro to Haskell's
sets]]. Get in the habit of perusing Hackage whenever you're using a
Haskell function or data type you don't quite understand. Sometimes
you'll have to just dive into the code, but sometimes there are
excellent intro docs like this. And yet there are also set operations
in ~Data.List~. Perhaps look into these two options.

[fn:21] Meanwhile, here's a brain-teaser that goes to the heart of
this set-list issue --- especially in Haskell, Why are set union and
intersection commutative and associative due to their lack of order?

[fn:22] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral][this]] brief discussion.

[fn:23] Typically, real numbers are represented geometrically by a
"number line" whereby /interval notation/ allows for sections of this
line to be considered, e.g., /closed interval/ $[\,a,b\,]\;$, /open
interval/ $(a,b)\:$, and more exotics like an /open ray/ $(-\infty, a)\:$.

[fn:24] We will eventually investigate how costly in computer time and
resources an operation like sorting is. Stay tuned.

[fn:25] A jigsaw puzzle can be seen as a sorting game based on shape,
color, and patterns of the pieces.

[fn:26] For a quick introduction with examples go [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses#typeclasses-101][here]] in LYAHFGG.

[fn:27] Go ahead and check out the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/Data-Eq.html][hackage.haskell.org]] entry for ~Eq~
[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/Data-Eq.html][here]]. Note the properties ~(==)~ should follow: reflexivity, symmetry,
transitivity, extentionality, and negation. We'll dive into what this
all means when we look closer into the higher algebra of sets and
functions. Note all the built-in, "batteries-included" ~Eq~ instances
for the various types. Some are rather exotic.

[fn:28] Quick LE question: Can functions be compared for equal-ness?
Here's a direct quote from a prominent combinatorics text: /When two
formulas enumerate the same set, then they must be equal./ But not so
fast in the computer world. To say ~f x == g x~ Haskell isn't
logically set up to actually prove (demonstrate) and accept that ~f~
and ~g~ always give the same results given the same ~x~ input. We
would literally have to test every possible ~x~, which is not
possible. Still, we'll examine this idea a bit closer soon. It's a
real big deal in numerical math.

[fn:29] Note ~{-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}~ which is a directive
meaning we may choose to define *either* ~(==)~ *or* (note the *or*
pipe *|* ) ~(/=)~, i.e., we don't actually have to define both because
by defining one, the other will be automatically generated. Neat.

[fn:30] ~:t~ is short for ~:type~.

[fn:31] /ad hoc/, from Latin /to this/, is something put together on
the fly for one narrow, pressing, or special purpose. /polymorphic/,
from Greek /polus/ much, many, and /morphism/, having the shape, form,
or structure, i.e., having many shapes.

[fn:32] As LYAHFGG says, ~Read~ and ~Show~ are also type classes to
which you may register your data type. Here we've used the ~deriving~
keyword to let Haskell figure it out, i.e., we're not defining
~Read~ and ~Show~ ourselves; rather, we're telling Haskell to
auto-generate and register these instances for us.

[fn:33] We'll go into more detail about declaring our own data types
as we progress. But for now we'll say ~Color~ is a /sum/ type, as
opposed to a /product/ type. Sum types are patterned after the
/addition principle/ which we'll also go into later. Note, the pipes
$\;|\;$ between the colors can be understood as logical /or/---as in
we must choose one /or/ the other of the colors.

[fn:34] ...and this is an example of /parametric polymorphism/ where
the /parameter/ (aka /type variable/) ~a~ can be any data type. In
Haskell, smaller-case letters such as ~a~, ~b~, ~c~, etc., are generic
parameter names and can indicate any data type. In ~(==) :: Eq a => a
-> a -> Bool~ we see that two inputs of the same type ~a~ are fed to
~(==)~, which produces a ~Bool~ output. Another example would be
~myFunc :: a -> b -> a~. Here the type signature says the inputs don't
have to be of the same type (although they could be), but no matter
what type the parameter ~b~ is, the output will be of type ~a~.

[fn:35] For our ~Color~ we've created our own equal-ness, although in
this example we could have let Haskell figure it out, i.e., ~...|
Green deriving (Eq)~ would have done the same thing. This was an easy
one. Haskell can't always figure out the less obvious cases.

[fn:36] The habit of calling a set of functions associated with a
Haskell type class /methods/ might be a hold/spill-over from the world
of object-oriented programming where an OOP class will have method
functions attached to it. This is called /encapsulation/, i.e., a
system for keeping things that belong together together. However, an
OOP class and a Haskell type class are entirely different beasts. So
let's keep our head stuck in the Haskell particle accelerator for
now...

[fn:37] In general, anytime your programming language starts writing
code for you, it's cool...

[fn:38] We make heavy use of the /wildcard/ ~_~ by which we mean /any/
variable can be in the ~_~ position. For example ~compare Red _ = GT~
means when we compare ~Red~ to anything else, ~Red~ will always be
greater than it. We also leveraged the order of these declarations,
i.e., by having ~compare Red _ = GT~ at the very start, ~Red~ versus
anything will be sorted out first. This is a /conditional/ situation
implicitly, which we'll use lots more.

[fn:39] Remember, math operators in Haskell are just a sort of
function. Which means ~(==) Red Red~ is identical to ~Red ==
Red~. Haskell requires operators in the function (/prefix/) position
to be in parentheses, whereas in the /infix/ (between) position they
can be naked operators. Notice ~min Red Yellow~ that ~min~ is in the
prefix position. Just put back-ticks around it to use it infix: ~Red `min` Yellow~.

[fn:40] This may be slightly confusing since in Algebra you probably
learned about constant functions expressed as, e.g., $f(x) = 5\;$,
which is just a horizontal line $y = 5$ for any $x\;$ you plug in.

[fn:41] If a data constructor (also called /value/ constructor) has a
nullary type constructor, as does ~Color~, then just like with $f() =
5$ the $5$ is a /constant/, and so are the values ~Red~, ~Yellow~, ~Blue~,
~Green~ considered constants.

[fn:42] We'll give data constructor ~Grant~ a list of elements of type
~String~, a Haskell ~String~ being, in reality, a /[[http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#type-synonyms][type synonym]]/ for
list of type ~Char~, which are individual Unicode characters. \\
~λ> "Tre Chic" == ['T','r','e',' ','C','h','i','c']~ \\
~True~

[fn:43] Haskell has great powers of inferring, i.e., when we ask it
what type ~visitorsOnGrant~ is, it deduces this from how we created
~visitorsOnGrant~, namely: ~visitorsOnGrant :: Num a => StreetShops a~.

[fn:44] As another example of introducing an abstract subject out of
the blue and way early, do you remember middle school math trying to
show you commutativity, distributivity, and associativity? Well, they
become important in higher math, especially in abstract
algebra. Haskell has lots of higher algebra baked in, and yes, you'll
finally see a real-world application of commutativity, distributivity,
and associativity soon!

[fn:45] Actually, our example ~:t 1~ relies on the method
~fromInteger~, but we'll unpack that later. Even more actually, a
whole lot of complex magic is going on behind the scenes when dealing
with naked (literal) numbers like this. So yes, this is an example of
LE for doing numbers on computers with programming languages.

[fn:46] Multiplication is often phrased, e.g., "five fives," i.e.,
five sets of five are to be considered (read added)
together. Likewise, division "divide $8$ by $2$ is just /subtract/ $2$
from $8$ over and over and keep track of how many times you can do
this until there's either nothing left or a number less than $2\;$.

[fn:47] Think about it, even when you've got a whole list (vertical or
horizontal) of numbers to add, you're really doing them two at a
time. One number becomes the /addend/ and the other becomes the
/augend/, which is sort of a carrying-over holder to which the next
addend is added. So if we're adding $1 + 2 + 5\;$ we might add $1 + 2\;$
and then remember the augend is $3\;$, then take addend $5$ and add it
to augend $3$ to get $8\;$.

[fn:48] More on Backus–Naur Form later. It's used extensively to
create a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax][metasyntax]] for programming languages. Maybe rabbit-hole [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form][this
Wikipedia treatment]].

[fn:49] Try Haskell's [[https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch3.html#x8-420003.11][list comprehension]]. Don't expect to understand
what they're saying just yet, but appreciate the magic and all the
devilish details. And while you're at it you might further appreciate
just what a list comprehension is by looking at [[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/List_comprehensions][this Rosetta Code
article]]. Again, YMMV on what you can grasp at this point, but maybe
notice how Haskell is /very/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation][Set-builder notation]]-friendly, while
other languages just seem to be kludging something together. Again,
maybe a bit too advanced, but check out [[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/List_comprehensions#Haskell][Haskell's entry]] for the
Pythagorean triplets. Experiment with the code. A big part of learning
to program is to read and experiment with code.

[fn:50] Have a look at [[https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Combinatorics_and_Discrete_Mathematics/Applied_Discrete_Structures_(Doerr_and_Levasseur)/16%3A_An_Introduction_to_Rings_and_Fields/16.01%3A_Rings_Basic_Definitions_and_Concepts][this LibreText explanation]] but don't try it
without first getting through the basic set theory stuff in the
assigned rabbit-hole.

[fn:51] Algebra in higher math is redefined to be a system that always
"packages" a set of numbers with a set of useful operators/operations
on those numbers. It's good to start thinking this way in order to
understand what Haskell and lots of computer science is doing and
saying.

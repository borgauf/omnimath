up. Specifically, <font color = "#650d1c">we&rsquo;ll <i>shadow</i>

<p>
There are many paths taken when learning Haskell. Being a very
advanced programming environment, it is rich in theoretical computer
science lore. But more than any other language (besides its cousins
Ocaml, SML, and F#) Haskell includes a surprising amount of higher
math. For example, Haskell leverages the abstract algebra concepts of
semigroups and monoids.

<p>
We&rsquo;ll save the more mathematical things for the main CIMIC show and
just concentrate on the Haskell programming nuts-and-bolts.

<li><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> (LYAHFGG) is a widely-used,
often-suggested beginners site for starting out with Haskell. We&rsquo;ll
work through it in our CIIC tutorial. (<i>R<sub>C</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>A site haskell.org is suggesting is the UPenn course CIS194. We
suggest the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring15/">Spring 2015</a> version since it includes haskell source
files. This is a college course, but for beginners. Click on the
<i>Lectures &amp; Assignments</i> link at the top. (If you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://github.com/borgauf/omnimath">our github
repository</a> there&rsquo;s a directory containing all the Haskell files.)
(<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>An older but still go-to site recommended by many is the <i><a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">Real
World Haskell</a></i> site (also book). As the title suggests, it has a
more real-applications slant, and yes, the material can get into
heavy lifting, but one great advantage is it has prodigious
<i>comments</i> attached to ever web page section. So if you didn&rsquo;t
understand something, typically somebody has already explained it
in depth.</li>
<li>Book-wise, a nice, well-paced text would be <i><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell#:~:text=about%20the%20book,dive%20into%20custom%20Haskell%20modules.">Get Programming with

beginner, intermediary, and advanced ideas. In other words, GPWH
gives plain-English explanations of things other treatments might go
deep into theory on. Really helpful, that. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>Another big favorite for Haskell starters, but slightly more
challenging is <i><a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/haskell-98-tutorial.pdf">A Gentle Introduction to Haskell 98</a></i>. AGITH uses
more math terminology, which is what we&rsquo;re doing, but from the
shallow end first. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>
<li>A while back the programming language Prolog created a list of
ninety-nine sample problems that were solved using Prolog. Since
then many languages have cooked up their own versions of answering
the ninety-nine. Haskell&rsquo;s is <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems">here</a>. We&rsquo;ll refer to this a lot. When
you peek at the solutions, don&rsquo;t get psyched out by some of the
answers. Haskell Wiki is a volunteer site and very smart people
like show off their skills resulting in some serious overkill. Just
make sure you can handle the basic answers, and maybe just peruse
the wilder versions. (<i>R<sub>O</sub>-hole</i>)</li>

<h2 id="orgc739fa4">Setting up Haskell</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc739fa4">
<p>
We will use <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">The Haskell Tool Stack</a>, which is a project/package
management system for Haskell. In a nutshell, we will install stack,
and then use stack to set up a custom Haskell programming
environment. Besides the executable <code>stack</code>, there will also be the
Haskell compiler <code>ghc</code> and the Haskell interactive mode <code>ghci</code> which
are called as stack arguments <br />
<code>&gt; stack ghci</code> <br />
<code>&gt; stack ghc</code> <br />
More on using them later.
</p>

<p>
This setup guide will go into detail only on the Linux Haskell
install. For full details (also for other OS types) see <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/">The Haskell
Tool Stack</a>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The very first step might not be needed, but we&rsquo;ll do it just to
make sure. Haskell requires (and recommends) a set of Linux system
programs and libraries. Run this at the command line (all on one
line)</li>
<li><code>&gt; sudo apt-get install g++ gcc libc6-dev libffi-dev libgmp-dev make
  xz-utils zlib1g-dev git gnupg netbase curl</code> <br />
Typically all of these (with the exception of curl) are already on
your system and won&rsquo;t be updated.</li>
<li>To install stack run <br />
<code>&gt; curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh</code> <br />
This will ask for your password; enter it to allow system-wide
install.</li>
<li>Now you should have Haskell stack on your system. For confirmation
of success run <br />
<code>&gt; which stack</code> <br />
This should return <br />
<code>/usr/local/bin/stack</code> <br />
or wherever the <code>stack</code> executable was installed.</li>
<li>Now, run <br />
<code>&gt; echo 'PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</code> <br />
This tells your shell environment<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Another name for terminal or command line is <i>shell</i>. Each
terminal you start with a command line interface is a <i>shell</i> with a
<i>shell environment</i>. The <code>.bashrc</code> file is its configuration file that
is read and set up each time you start another terminal command line
instance.
</span> about this new location
where some of Haskell executables might be later on if we choose to
install them. We&rsquo;re not now, but it&rsquo;s good to have this ahead of
time. Kill your terminal, restart it, then check with <br />
<code>&gt; echo $PATH</code> <br />
You should see something like <br />
<code>&gt; /home/myhomedir/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:...</code> <br />
&#x2026;and many others possibly. But we see our
<code>/home/myhomedir/.local/bin</code>. Good.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Again, stack is project-oriented. That means you have one programming
&ldquo;project&rdquo; that you want to accomplish. But for the time being we only
want to use the Haskell REPL<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<b>REPL</b> stands for <i>read, evaluate, print, loop</i>, which is
essentially what your terminal command line is doing. That is to say,
the Haskell REPL, called <i>ghci</i> is an interactive world: Give it a
task, e.g., <code>1 + 1</code>, and it returns a response, <code>2</code>, then it gives you
back a prompt and waits for your next task. This is how LYAHFGG starts
out executing Haskell code.
</span> to load the practice code we saved
into <code>*.hs</code> files, i.e., not a single project. Still, these <code>*.hs</code>
will reside in a project directory, a project that we set up with
stack &#x2014; even though we won&rsquo;t use the project files
specifically. Eventually, we&rsquo;ll convert from using <code>hs</code> loaded into
the REPL session to using Emacs&rsquo; powerful <i>org-mode literate
programming</i> with the REPL. And then we might actually use the project
way to program in Haskell, especially if we want to create a
stand-alone executable.

<li>In your top home directory<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span> directory <br />
<code>&gt; mkdir org</code> <br />
and <code>cd</code> into it <br />
<code>&gt; cd org</code></li>
<li>Now we&rsquo;ll create a project, which will automatically create a new
directory with the same name under <code>~/org/</code>. Type <br />
<code>&gt; stack new haskellwork1</code> (or whatever you want to call it) <br />
which will set up a project in a subdirectory of <code>org</code> called
<code>haskellwork1</code>.</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into <code>haskellwork1</code> and do <code>ls</code> to get a file listing. You&rsquo;ll
see many newly created files and directories. But again, we will not
use them at this point.</li>
<li>Still in the <code>haskellwork1</code> directory type
<code>&gt; stack setup</code> <br />
which should give a short message about using a sandboxed GHC etc.</li>
<li>Next, type <code>&gt; stack build</code> <br />
which will run through an executable build procedure and return you
the prompt. This actually builds the starter-dummy project we just
created. All of this creates a Haskell programming environment we
want.</li>
<li>To test our starter-dummy project&rsquo;s new executable run <br />
<code>&gt; stack exec haskellwork1-exe</code> <br />
which will return <code>someFucn</code>, i.e., the output of the project&rsquo;s
dummy starter code. Again, this is just testing that the Haskell
environment is ready. We&rsquo;ll be creating our practice files in the
<code>haskellwork1</code> directory completely independent of the
<code>haskellwork1</code> project.</li>

<h3 id="org2bd1757"><i>So what&rsquo;s Haskell?</i> State and referential transparency</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2bd1757">
<p>
In just his <i>So what&rsquo;s Haskell?</i> section Miran says a lot, so let&rsquo;s
unpack it a bit<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Actually, this page will deal only with that first
paragraph. The rest we&rsquo;ll incorporate in later pages.
</span>.  First is the concept of <i>state</i>, which is a
very big deal in computers, physics and engineering, as well as many
other STEM and soft-science fields. When we say <i>the state of things</i>
we mean the present conditions &#x2014; which implies that the state might
change. And we might have heard of <i>phase</i>, e.g., the three phases of
matter: solid, liquid, and gaseous<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In addition to the states solid, liquid, gas, there&rsquo;s also
crystalline, colloid, glassy, amorphous, and plasma.
</span>. You&rsquo;ll hear the terms phase
of matter and the state of matter used interchangeably. In our
treatment we will borrow from an explanation given by Susskind and
Hrabovsky in their book <i>The Theoretical Minimum</i><label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
See the video <a href="https://youtu.be/ApUFtLCrU90">here</a>. Just the first part is germane to our
discussion here.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Basically, a given situation we&rsquo;re examining, a given <i>system</i>, can
have
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom">degrees of freedom</a> (DOF)</li>
<li>states</li>
<li>rules or laws describing the system&rsquo;s progress or behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>
In their book, Susskind and Hrabovsky begin with a system consisting
of one coin glued down to a table with heads up. So we have <b>one coin</b>
(corresponding to one parameter or DOF) and just one possible <b>state</b>
of this single DOF<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Degrees of freedom are not exactly the same as variables. A
Cartesian coordinate system (CCS) with \(x\) and \(y\) axes can be thought
of as a system with two DOF &#x2014; or just one DOF. The difference is the
relationship \(x\) and \(y\) are in. DOFs must be truly independent of one
another. So if we&rsquo;re just establishing a CCS as <i>all possible
coordinate pairs</i>, both elements of a pair corresponding to all the
real numbers running up and down each axis, then yes, the CCS has two
DOFs. But if we&rsquo;re talking about a function \(f(x) = y\;\) depicted on a
CCS then we mean only one DOF, \(x;\) since the \(y\) is now considered
<i>dependent</i> on \(x\), i.e., not free. Knowing this, how many DOFs does
an operating traffic light have, one, two, three?
</span> coin, namely <b>heads</b>. If we try to describe
this system, i.e., describe a <b>law</b> for the behavior of this system,
we can intuitively see that it&rsquo;s extremely restricted and
minimalistic. The law for this system would simply be <i>the state is
always heads</i>, i.e., the state never changes. Not very interesting,
not very information-rich<label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Contrast this with a <i>writing system</i> like English with
twenty-six letters, which in comp-sci-speak is a &ldquo;nonempty finite set
of symbols.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s an infinite number of possible states of our
English writing system, especially considering all the millions of
people using it!
</span>.
</p>

<p>
We know intuitively what <i>always</i> means: constant, eternal, never
ending. Such words imply time passing, steps, iterations taken &#x2014; and
a thing, a system remaining basically constant, the same. Words like
<i>perpetual</i>, <i>continual</i>, <i>periodic</i>, <i>intermittent</i>, <i>random</i>,
<i>cyclic</i>, <i>acyclic</i>, <i>terminating</i>, <i>non-terminating</i>, <i>dynamic</i>,
<i>static</i> and many others all beg the notion of some process moving
along, step-by-step perhaps, or assessed at intervals of time. Even
words like <i>deterministic</i> and <i>chaotic</i> invoke the idea of something
being repeatedly measured as to its state, then a <i>pattern</i>, a
<i>sequence</i><label for="12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
When we use <i>sequence</i> we&rsquo;ll be leaning into the mathematical
meaning. Basically, a sequence is a an <i>ordered</i> list of things,
objects, numbers that may or may not exhibit a pattern. As we explore
<i>set theory</i> we&rsquo;ll see math explained in terms of sets. For example, a
sequence can be thought of as a function that maps the <i>set</i> of
natural counting numbers (\(\mathbb{N} = 0,1,2,3,\ldots\;\;\;\)) to the
<i>set</i> of objects that make up our ordered list. This may seem odd at
first, but we just introduced the idea of <i>indexing</i> or <i>enumerating</i>
the numerical position of the elements of our sequence.
</span> of states is generalized to a descriptive adjective.
</p>

<p>
A single coin system &#x2014; not glued down &#x2014; has one DOF with just two
possible states, to be decided by flipping the coin. We may then
perform a <i>sequence</i> of coin flips at our leisure to determine this
sequence of flips&rsquo; pattern, i.e., the coin-flip system&rsquo;s
law<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Think about how a car moving <i>continuously</i> along a road. We
could literally check its location down to the millisecond, giving us
a very fine, very time-dependent snapshot of its location. However,
coin flipping, which results in heads or tails, is <i>discrete</i>, i.e.,
when the coin lands it is instantly one or the other; hence, the
continuous passing of time isn&rsquo;t relevant in the discrete world. Lots
more on <i>discrete</i> math coming.
</span>. For example, if we flip our coin over and over and it
magically alternates between heads or tails, never deviating, we may
describe it, establish its law as following this formula<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
(1) is an example of a <i>recurrence relation</i>. You&rsquo;re probably
more used to <i>closed</i> formulae. For example \(f(x) = x^{2}\;\) is a closed
version of this recurrence relation <br />

\begin{align*}
f(0) &= 0 \\
f(n) &= f(n-1) + 2n-1 \;\; for \; n \ge 1
\end{align*}

Lots more on recurrence relations and recursion in general later.
</span>
</p>

\begin{align}
\sigma(n+1) = -\sigma(n)
\end{align}

<p>
In (1), \(\sigma\) (<i>sigma</i>) will stand for our single DOF. For the possible
values of \(\sigma\) we say \(1\) means heads and \(-1\) means tails. \(n\) stands
for the counting numbers (\(1,2,3,\ldots\;\)) that will serve to <i>index</i>
each coin flip in a sequence of coin flips. For example, if on our
first flip \(\sigma(1) = 1\;\), heads, then according to (1) our second flip
\(\sigma(2)\;\) will be \(-1\;\) or tails since
</p>

\begin{align*}
\sigma(1) &= 1\;\;\ldots\;\; \text{heads is our starting point} \\
\sigma(2) &= -\sigma(1) \;\;\ldots\;\; \text{using (1)} \\
\sigma(2) &= -(1)  \;\;\ldots\;\; \text{substituting} \\
\sigma(2) &= -1 \quad \ldots\;\text{tails}
\end{align*}

<p>
The third flip in our sequence is
</p>

\begin{align*}
\sigma(2) &= -1\;\;\ldots\;\; \text{tails is our starting point} \\
\sigma(3) &= -\sigma(2) \;\;\ldots\;\; \text{using (1)} \\
\sigma(3) &= -(-1)  \;\;\ldots\;\; \text{substituting} \\
\sigma(3) &= 1 \;\;\ldots\;\; \text{heads}
\end{align*}

We won&rsquo;t go into how this can be incorporated into our function <code>œÉ</code>

theory math world) this correspondence is called an
<i>isomorphism</i>. Which basically means we can set up a translation
between these two representations of a flip outcome. Can you think of
other &ldquo;either-or&rdquo; two-possibility types?  <i>True</i> and <i>False</i>, or <i>Top</i>
and <i>Bottom</i>, <i>Left</i> and <i>Right</i>, or even <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> or <i>Mine</i>

can create a translation from one to the other<label for="18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="18" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
One way of &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; in a two-state system from one state to

works out of the box for some types, while for others the concept of
negation must be defined. Right. What would it mean to <i>negate</i> <code>Moon</code>

Since we know timekeeping, we&rsquo;re familiar with this idea of \(x\) hours
from now is \(y\) o&rsquo;clock. According to our table above, \(17\) or
\(17\!:\!00\;\) matches with \(5\;\) o&rsquo;clock, again, this is just military
time. Now, what time would it be \(237\) hours from \(2:00\;\)<label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Let&rsquo;s forget counting days for now.
</span>?
Or, at the \(2 + 237 = 239\;\;\) state change, what is the state of our
system given our system law is \(12\) strictly increasing and repeating
states?
</p>

<p>
In modularity arithmetic we&rsquo;re asking what number(s) is(are)
<i>congruent</i> with \(239\) <i>modulo</i> \(12\;\), written \(239 \equiv x (mod
12)\;\;\)?  This means if we line up \(1\) through \(12\;\), strictly
increasing, over and over, back to back, matching them to our counting
number index, \(239\) must match with some possible hour between \(1\) and
\(12\;\).
</p>

<p>
Probably your first intuitive idea would be to just divide: \(239 \div 12
=\; ?\;\) &#x2026; But we must be careful here, we&rsquo;re in the realm of
discrete numbers. Just any old calculator will give you a decimal
number if it doesn&rsquo;t divide it evenly, i.e., remainder zero. Let&rsquo;s
take a look at what Haskell does with a simpler situation from our
table above. Consider \(14\) hours after starting. Again, with military
time we see it corresponds to \(2\;\) o&rsquo;clock, however,
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>14 <span class="org-haskell-operator">/</span> 12
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
1.1666666666666667
</pre>


<p>
Unless we want to do some extra math (\(0.166667 \cdot 12 = 2.0\;\;\;\)), we
should try something else. Here&rsquo;s a better way: Haskell&rsquo;s <code>quot</code> will
give only the <i>quotient</i> part of a division
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>14 <span class="org-haskell-operator">`quot`</span> 12
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
1
</pre>


<p>
So \(12\) &ldquo;goes into&rdquo; \(14\) one time, and the <i>remainder</i> of \(14 \div 12\;\)
is
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>14 <span class="org-haskell-operator">`rem`</span> 12
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
2
</pre>


<p>
or, even handier
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>14 <span class="org-haskell-operator">`quotRem`</span> 12
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
(1,2)
</pre>


<p>
where the pair <code>(1,2)</code> indicates \(1\) for the quotient and \(2\) for the
remainder. Let&rsquo;s try it on our bigger number
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>239 <span class="org-haskell-operator">`quotRem`</span> 12
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
(19,11)
</pre>


<p>
Hmmm. Is one of these our answer, i.e., the first or second number in
this <i>tuple</i>? Well, our table above only seems to match two
twelve-hour clocks with a twenty-four-hour clock, then two more into
the third twelve-hour clock. Perhaps the answer is saying we went \(19\)
bunches of \(12\) forward, which amounted to \(228\;\), then we needed to
go \(11\) additional hours to get to hour \(239\;\). Does that make sense?
</p>

<p>
One calculator on the Internet says \(239\) hours is \(9\) days and \(23\)
hours. But since a day is \(24\) hours, we should double \(9\) since there
are two go-rounds of the clock per day. That means \(18\) twelve-hour
half-days. Now \(23 - 12 = 11\;\;\). So adding in that last \(12\) hours
to \(18\) to get \(19\), we have what our <code>quotRem</code> calculation gave us,
\(19\) twelve-hour blocks, plus the additional \(11\) hours. In modular
math, we would say \(239 \equiv 11 \;mod\; (12)\;\), that is, \(239\) is
congruent to \(11\) modulo \(12\), which effectively means that as the
hours or state changes continue, \(11\) and \(239\) are related by being
multiples of \(12\) from each other, in fact, \(19\) multiples of \(12\)
separate them.

<h3 id="org4b80dd3">Throwing dice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4b80dd3">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at dice as a system. Actually, we&rsquo;ll just consider one
single six-sided die, i.e., the six possible states in which the die
system might be in after a throw. Using the Haskell <b>list</b> <i>data
structure</i>, the <i>state space</i> can be expressed as elements of a list
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-haskell-definition">dieState</span> <span class="org-haskell-operator">=</span> <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">[</span>1,2,3,4,5,6<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
‚ûù Question: Does the <i>order</i> of our states list matter, i.e., we have
  <i>enumeration</i> of the six states, but is there <i>ordinality</i>? <br />
‚ûù Answer: Yes and no. Just considering a listing of the possible
  states, i.e., a state space list, no. But if we talk about a
  sequence of throws, then a list of the sequential progression of
  state changes would of course depend on order.
</p>

<p>
Again, the Haskell list data structure will be our best substitute for
a mathematical set or sequence, and we&rsquo;ll work around its
limitations. For example, the Haskell lists <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6]</code> and
<code>[6,5,4,3,2,1]</code> are two different and unequal lists, even though as
mathematical sets they are considered the same. Hence, Haskell lists
aren&rsquo;t the best for math sets where order (and even repeating
elements) don&rsquo;t matter. But lists are adequate in depicting a math
sequence where the sequential order matters and a repeating element
does in fact mean a state has been repeated at that point.
</p>

<p>
Like in our coin example, we&rsquo;ll start with a loaded or trick die that
produces a steady repeating pattern of
\(1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots\;\;\;\) for \(1,2,3,\ldots,n\;\)
rolls. The system <i>cycles</i>, i.e., repeats a six-throw sequence
pattern<label for="21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="21" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Interestingly, a system that cycles in a <i>probabilistic</i> way,
i.e., there&rsquo;s a given <i>chance</i> of a certain state change happening,
would be the domain of <a href="https://www.fa17.eecs70.org/static/notes/n24.html">Markov chains</a>, which we&rsquo;ll look at later.
</span>. Hence, it is <i>modular</i> like our clock example above
where <font color = "#650d1c">every state of the sequence
will be <i>congruent</i> to one of the elements of the state
space</font>.

<i>combinations</i> or a <i>permutations</i> issue?

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
</font>
</p>

<p>
This maybe sounds like what we want. One common math symbol for
<i>combinations</i> is \(_nC_{k}\;\), another is \(C_{n}^{k}\;\). Another look often
seen with the binomial coefficient is \(\binom{n}{k} \;\). However,
these indicate the <i>number</i> of possible combinations, not a listing of
the combinations themselves. You might have seen \(\binom{n}{k} \;\) or
\(_nC_{k}\;\) in calculating the <i>binomial coefficients</i> of the expansion
of a <i>binomial</i> raised to a power: \((x + y)^n \;\). This is meant to
calculate the coefficient. So no, these are not what we want. We want
something that creates sequences, not just returns a count.

<p>
This output is all possible combinations of <i>three states into groups
of two states each</i>. Already we can see a problem. Yes, these are
<i>unique</i> orderings of three into groups of two, like our definition
above says. But what about <code>[2,1]</code> or <code>[3,1]</code> or <code>[3,2]</code>? Why were
they not listed? Let&rsquo;s try the possible <i>unique</i> ordering of six
states into groups of six.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-haskell-definition">combinations</span> 6 <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">[</span>1,2,3,4,5,6<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">]</span>
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
[[1,2,3,4,5,6]]
</pre>


<p>
Our code says only one possible &ldquo;unique&rdquo; grouping is returned. Now
it&rsquo;s clear that combinations is not what we want. We need something
with awareness of sequences, i.e., the <i>order</i> of the possible
groupings matter.
</p>

<p>
‚á≤<font color = "#650d1c"> What about a <i>combination</i> lock? If
the &ldquo;combination&rdquo; of the lock is <code>[5,15,7]</code>, would <code>[15,5,7]</code> or
<code>[15,7,5]</code> or <code>[7,5,15]</code> or <code>[7,15,5]</code> also open the lock? No &#x2014; at
least they shouldn&rsquo;t. So if only one <i>sequence</i> of three numbers opens
the lock, then we should call it a <i>permutation</i> lock.</font>
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at our die state space again as a Haskell list, at this
point order just for convenience <code>a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</code>. How could we
build new six-element lists &#x2014; not repeating any of the numbers &#x2014;
all with unique orders? Again, position in a sequence or a Haskell
list matters. So when we choose <i>one</i> of the six numbers from <code>a</code> we
have <i>eliminated</i> it from consideration for the rest of the
positions. That means we have \(6-1\;\) or \(5\) choices for the next
position. This patter continues until we only have the one choice for
the last position in the sequence/list.
</p>

<p>
If we want all the possible state change sequences we could use this
code

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfb0bf68">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with an example of what a program state scenario might
look like. In programming we routinely need to repeat or iterate some
task a given number of times. Imperative languages typically use
<i>loops</i>, while functional languages use recursion. For a very basic
example consider <i>factorial</i>, i.e., \(n!\;\), first in Python
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-keyword">def</span> <span class="org-function-name">factorial</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span>n<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>:
    <span class="org-variable-name">num</span> = 1
    <span class="org-keyword">while</span> n &gt;= 1:

        <span class="org-variable-name">n</span> = n - 1
    <span class="org-keyword">return</span> num
</code></pre>

<p>
<code>factorial</code> takes <code>n</code> as its input parameter, then it establishes the
variable <code>num</code> that will serve as a <i>counter</i> or <i>index</i>. Then begins
what is knows as a <i>while loop</i>. The indentation tells us that the
next two steps <code>num = num * n</code> and <code>n = n - 1</code> will be repeated
<i>while</i> the condition <code>n &gt;= 1</code> is true<label for="27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="27" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<code>n &gt;= 1</code> <i>n is greater than or equal to 1</i>.
</span>, the <code>n = n - 1</code> line
<i>decrementing</i> <code>n</code> each time through. For example, starting with <code>n</code>
as <code>4</code>, the state of this code when it enters its while loop is

<p>
and the returned value <code>num</code> in its latest and final state, is
<code>24</code>. And so we see how an imperative-style programming language
relies on updating variables, i.e., <i>changing the state of variables</i>.
In our example <code>n</code> and <code>num</code> are both updated four times during the
while loop.
</p>

<p>
A purely functional language like Haskell, however, never declares a
variable and then later changes its value, its state. A repeating task
or calculation done with a loop are handled exclusively by
recursion. We&rsquo;ll have a more detailed exploration of recursion later,
but for now let&rsquo;s just look at factorial in simple Haskell code<label for="28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="28" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We&rsquo;ll learn all of Haskell&rsquo;s conditional operators, e.g., <code>a

</code></pre>

<p>
Here we see functional programming&rsquo;s secret weapon, i.e., the ability
of a function to call itself, to refer to itself, to go back into
itself over and over. Recalling a previous recurrence relation
example, we can write factorial as a recurrence relation<label for="29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="29" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
What would be the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; version of factorial? Convince
yourself <br />

\begin{align*}
n! = \prod_{i=1}^{n }i
\end{align*}

the recursive and closed versions are identical. BTW, a Haskell
version of this would be <code>factClosed n = product [1..n]</code>
</span>
</p>

\begin{align*}
f(0) &= 1  \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad for \;\;\; n = 0 \\
f(n) &= n \cdot f(n-1) \;\; for \; n \ge 1
\end{align*}

<p>
we see the same basic idea, i.e., we establish a starting value or
<i>base case</i> for \(f\) when \(n\) is \(0\;\), then a recursive step for all
\(n\) not \(0\) where \(f(n)\) is being defined in terms of a previous
version of itself \(f(n-1)\;\). Let&rsquo;s evaluate it
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-haskell-definition">factorial</span> 4
</code></pre>

<pre class="example">
24
</pre>


<p>
So what do you imagine is happening with this <code>factorial</code> code where
it seems to be going back into itself &#x2014; over and over? Let&rsquo;s imagine
a game you might play with a group of people who will help you with an
adding game. We&rsquo;ll start with you and a group of people all sitting in
a circle facing each other. You all roll your die and remember your
numbers. You rolled \(4\;\) That means you&rsquo;ll stand up and go around the
circle counter-clockwise to the fourth person and ask them their
number. Sally is the fourth person and she rolled a \(2\). You write
down \(2\;\). Moving back clockwise, Ralph is next and his number is
\(6\). You write down \(+ \;6\) after the \(2\) just like adding
horizontally. Next, is Harriet and her number is \(5\). Now you have
\(2 + 6 + 5\;\) written down. The last person coming back clockwise is
Kurt and his number is \(1\;\). Now you have \(2 + 6 + 5 + 1\;\) and
you&rsquo;re back where you started. You then add up the four numbers to get
\(14\;\).
</p>

<p>
Obviously, you could play this game of adding random numbers chosen
between \(1\) and \(6\) with just two other people. So you roll your die
and get \(4\) again. So you tell Sally to remember \(4\;\), who this time
will be your indexer/counter. Then Ralph, who will be the accumulator
or <i>augend</i><label for="30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="30" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<b>augend</b>: the number to which another is added, which can then
server as an accumulator. Why is there an <i>augend</i> and an <i>addend</i>
with addition? Because addition is a <i>binary operation</i>. Despite the
illusion of adding a whole column of numbers at once, at the
computational level, addition is happening between two and only two
numbers at a time, i.e., both in the digital circuitry and abstract
algebra. We&rsquo;ll discuss where this misunderstanding arises when we
investigate the associativity nature of binary operations.
</span> this time, rolls his die. Ralph rolls \(2\) and
remembers. Then Sally subtracts \(1\) from \(4\) to get \(3\). Then Ralph
rolls again and gets \(6\). He adds the previous \(2\) to \(6\) in his head
to get \(8\) and makes sure to remember. Sally again <i>decrements</i> \(3\) to
\(2\;\). Ralph again rolls and gets \(5\). He adds this to his previous
\(8\) and now has \(13\). Sally decrements to \(2\). Ralph rolls and gets
\(1\), then adds this to \(13\) to get \(14\;\). Sally decrements to \(1\),
which will signal a halt to Ralph rolling and adding. Ralph reports
his final amount as \(14\;\).
</p>

<p>
The circle version of this might seem a tad long and drawn-out, the
two-person version more &ldquo;compact,&rdquo; but what is the fundamental
difference? The answer is important to understanding what separates
imperative and declarative functional programming. One version is
constantly changing the state of variables, the other is not. Think
about it. With the circle version of adding random numbers, is
anything we might consider a degree of freedom or variable being
changed? No. We&rsquo;re simply manipulating, rewriting terms like when we
work out a formula given an input and then we <i>show our work</i>. Why do
this?  That&rsquo;s also a big deal. It holds the &ldquo;no side effects&rdquo; mandate
of pure functional programming, &ldquo;side effects&rdquo; being the changing of
variable states. It&rsquo;s also functions not always returning the same
values given the same inputs. <i>But isn&rsquo;t this too restrictive?</i> you
might ask, <i>after all, if you&rsquo;re careful all should be good.</i> Ha!
These are &ldquo;famous last words&rdquo; in the computer world. Yes, tolerating
side effects inside of functions where the <i>scope</i> of changing
variables is limited to just that function would seem safe, but what
about a so-called <i>global</i> variable, i.e., a variable accessible to
different functions throughout the code? The classic bug is when one
part of your code changes a variable that another part did not realize
had been changed and then causes an error.
</p>

<p>
But doesn&rsquo;t no side effects also mean we can&rsquo;t even ask simple things
like <i>list all the files in directory X</i>? After all, the function
<code>listfiles</code> would give different answers for different directories,
thereby violating your <i>referential transparency</i> rule. Yes and
no. Haskell has a trick called <i>monads</i> that is a work-around, i.e.,
Haskell stays pure, but keeps a method handy to allow some side
effect.

Was all this just about one paragraph? Yes, this has been a very
long-winded unpacking of just that first <i>So what&rsquo;s Haskell</i>
paragraph, but remember that we&rsquo;re on the hunt for the computer
version of the &ldquo;mental representations&rdquo; of mathematics. This can get
quite exacting and involved. But formalistic rigor is your friend in
this realm. And again, we can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that comp-sci
programs hit this stuff hard! So we&rsquo;re about building an on-ramp to
this computer-based &ldquo;mental representation&rdquo;. After all comp-sci got
most of its methods and concepts from higher math.

Another name for terminal or command line is <i>shell</i>. Each
terminal you start with a command line interface is a <i>shell</i> with a
<i>shell environment</i>. The <code>.bashrc</code> file is its configuration file that
is read and set up each time you start another terminal command line
instance.

<b>REPL</b> stands for <i>read, evaluate, print, loop</i>, which is
essentially what your terminal command line is doing. That is to say,
the Haskell REPL, called <i>ghci</i> is an interactive world: Give it a
task, e.g., <code>1 + 1</code>, and it returns a response, <code>2</code>, then it gives you
back a prompt and waits for your next task. This is how LYAHFGG starts
out executing Haskell code.

Degrees of freedom are not exactly the same as variables. A
Cartesian coordinate system (CCS) with \(x\) and \(y\) axes can be thought
of as a system with two DOF &#x2014; or just one DOF. The difference is the
relationship \(x\) and \(y\) are in. DOFs must be truly independent of one
another. So if we&rsquo;re just establishing a CCS as <i>all possible
coordinate pairs</i>, both elements of a pair corresponding to all the
real numbers running up and down each axis, then yes, the CCS has two
DOFs. But if we&rsquo;re talking about a function \(f(x) = y\;\) depicted on a
CCS then we mean only one DOF, \(x;\) since the \(y\) is now considered
<i>dependent</i> on \(x\), i.e., not free. Knowing this, how many DOFs does
an operating traffic light have, one, two, three?

Contrast this with a <i>writing system</i> like English with
twenty-six letters, which in comp-sci-speak is a &ldquo;nonempty finite set
of symbols.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s an infinite number of possible states of our
English writing system, especially considering all the millions of
people using it!

When we use <i>sequence</i> we&rsquo;ll be leaning into the mathematical
meaning. Basically, a sequence is a an <i>ordered</i> list of things,
objects, numbers that may or may not exhibit a pattern. As we explore
<i>set theory</i> we&rsquo;ll see math explained in terms of sets. For example, a
sequence can be thought of as a function that maps the <i>set</i> of
natural counting numbers (\(\mathbb{N} = 0,1,2,3,\ldots\;\;\;\)) to the
<i>set</i> of objects that make up our ordered list. This may seem odd at
first, but we just introduced the idea of <i>indexing</i> or <i>enumerating</i>
the numerical position of the elements of our sequence.

Think about how a car moving <i>continuously</i> along a road. We
could literally check its location down to the millisecond, giving us
a very fine, very time-dependent snapshot of its location. However,
coin flipping, which results in heads or tails, is <i>discrete</i>, i.e.,
when the coin lands it is instantly one or the other; hence, the
continuous passing of time isn&rsquo;t relevant in the discrete world. Lots
more on <i>discrete</i> math coming.

(1) is an example of a <i>recurrence relation</i>. You&rsquo;re probably
more used to <i>closed</i> formulae. For example \(f(x) = x^{2}\;\) is a closed
version of this recurrence relation <br />

\begin{align*}
f(0) &= 0 \\
f(n) &= f(n-1) + 2n-1 \;\; for \; n \ge 1

Lots more on recurrence relations and recursion in general later.

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.15" class="footnum" href="#fnr.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
This Haskell code is meant to be just show-and-tell. If you&rsquo;ve
read ahead you should be able to follow it. Quickly, we have a <i>base
case</i>, i.e., the first line where we establish whether the first flip
is heads or tails, then the recurrence relationship. <i>Lots</i> more about
Haskell recursion soon. (BTW, <code>--</code> is a Haskell comment, not part of
the program.)

Again, this is show code. We&rsquo;ve used the unicode symbol œÉ for
sigma because Haskell recognizes it and it&rsquo;s cool to look as
mathematical as possible, but usually we&rsquo;ll just spell out function
names.
</p></div></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.17" class="footnum" href="#fnr.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup> <div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"><p class="footpara">
<code>map</code> is a function that takes a function, in our case œÉ, and
applies it to the individual elements of a <b>list</b>, then outputs the
resulting new list. This is our first demonstration of a functional
programming superpower, i.e., functions using not just regular data as
input, but other functions as well. Lots to come on this subject.
</p></div></div>

One way of &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; in a two-state system from one state to
the other would be <i>negation</i>, e.g., \(Negate(1) = -1\;\;\). The Haskell
operator <code>not</code> does this (the math logic symbol is \(\lnot\;\;\)), which
works out of the box for some types, while for others the concept of
negation must be defined. Right. What would it mean to <i>negate</i> <code>Moon</code>
to <code>Sun</code> back to <code>Moon</code> again? More on this trick later.

In math the elements of a sequence are strictly
consecutive. Again, a sequence&rsquo;s elements <i>and</i> their order makes it
unique.

Interestingly, a system that cycles in a <i>probabilistic</i> way,
i.e., there&rsquo;s a given <i>chance</i> of a certain state change happening,

<b>augend</b>: the number to which another is added, which can then
server as an accumulator. Why is there an <i>augend</i> and an <i>addend</i>
with addition? Because addition is a <i>binary operation</i>. Despite the
illusion of adding a whole column of numbers at once, at the
computational level, addition is happening between two and only two
numbers at a time, i.e., both in the digital circuitry and abstract
algebra. We&rsquo;ll discuss where this misunderstanding arises when we
investigate the associativity nature of binary operations.

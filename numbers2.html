To be sure, <i>enumeration</i>, or as it is also called <i>combinatorics</i>, is
a huge and active field of mathematics, parts of which are included in
introductions to Discrete Mathematics, and in general, are fair game
throughout a CS degree. This means our approach with CIMIC will have
to be rather pruned and directed, since the combinatorics tree is big
and bushy.
</p>

<p>
Truth be told, the first time you hear about enumeration as a
beginning Haskeller isn&rsquo;t really about all this deep, bushy math,
rather doing things like completing a <i>range</i><label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

In this next example we use the open-ended &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; list &#x2014;
which will typically go on forever, locking up your computer as it
tries to list <i>all</i> of numbers, or in this case letters. We use the
function <code>take</code> to take just the first <code>27</code> letters and not go any
further. Curiously, Haskell thinks the twenty-seventh letter is
<code>{</code>. That&rsquo;s because these are <i>unicode</i> characters, of which there are
some 1,114,015, according to Haskell. It&rsquo;s usually safe to use an

<p>
This is a tool of Haskell&rsquo;s that allows us to &ldquo;enumerate&rdquo; (fill in) a
pattern of list elements. And it should be no surprise that Haskell
has a type class, <code>Enum</code> to which types can register instances. <code>Enum</code>
has special method functions which create this behavior, this
enumeration-ness, for a data type. But before we talk about <code>Enum</code>,
let&rsquo;s work with the more discrete math side of things.

&#x2026;completing a numerical layout given certain conditions perhaps?
It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to describe what enumeration is. To count
something might seem like a dynamic process. We take objects out of a
box and <i>count</i> how many there are &#x2014; with each object increasing the
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/augend">augend</a>, the final augend being the answer. In simple language this is
finding a sum. But what if finding, e.g., a sum isn&rsquo;t as simple as
just grabbing one after another out of a box? What if the grabbing
<i>and</i> the displaying, arranging, stacking on the table is complex and
involved? There are many situations that have very deep, very complex
grabbing, and arranging processes.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to display a set is to literally list out each
element one by one. This is considered enumeration as well. Then
there&rsquo;s the use of <i><font color = "#650d1c" size =
5%>ellipses (&#x2026;)</font></i> to indicate we want elements
&ldquo;filled out&rdquo; according to some scheme we&rsquo;re following. But here we
encounter LE issues, ambiguities. For example \(\{1,2,3,\ldots\}\;\)
could mean a listing of the counting numbers, or it might indicate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a> where each new number (beyond the first two) is the

<h3 id="orge46d223">Peano&rsquo;s approach to the natural numbers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge46d223">
<p>
The latter half of the nineteenth century saw mathematics going
through an intense effort to expand and deepen mathematical formalism
and exactness. Mathematicians wanted to firm up math&rsquo;s logical
underpinnings, clean up sloppy, intuitive, hand-waving
half-understandings and put things on solid, unassailable logical
footing. One such mathematician was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a>.
</p>

<p>
Logical soul-searching led Peano to ask what exactly were the counting
numbers after all? Sure, there&rsquo;s the Kindergarten version of
\(\mathbb{N}\;\), but was there something set-theoretic foundational
underneath just rattling off numbers like a child? After all, that&rsquo;s
not much different from circus animals learning tricks.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s warm up by considering what we said in the last section about
\(3\) being what comes after \(2\), which in turn comes after \(1\;\). In
effect, one number <i>succeeds</i> another. And so, in theory at least, we
could start at \(0\;\) and literally build a chain of <i>succeeds</i> up
to any number we want. This is like saying every journey starts with a
first step, followed by the next step, then the next, etc. Yes, this
may seen trivial, silly, but there&rsquo;s a lot of math packed in this
concept.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org422f4a7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org422f4a7">A first stab at a formalization</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org422f4a7">
<p>
Later we&rsquo;ll go into a more detail about what a function is
set-theoretically, but to get started that brutalist interpretation of
functions you learned sometime after Kindergarten will do. So let&rsquo;s
have the idea of one thing succeeding another housed in a <i>successor
function</i> \(S(n)\;\). And yet we won&rsquo;t say something like
</p>

\begin{align*}
S(n) = n + 1
\end{align*}

<p>
because that would be too, well, brutalist. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if we start at \(0\), the successor to \(0\) is \(1\;\), or
\(S(0) = 1\;\). But if we&rsquo;re going to be highly abstract and pure about
this, we don&rsquo;t want or need to connect this to any actual numerical
symbols of base\(_{10}\) like \(1\;\). So we&rsquo;ll just use the usual numerical
symbols as reminders. Let&rsquo;s  So in order to Instead, we&rsquo;ll just keep
reapplying the successor function \(S\;\) similar to nesting Russian
dolls<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Russian or <i>matryoshka</i> dolls: <br />
<img src="images/russiandolls.png" alt="russiandolls.png" />  <br />
<br />
</span>
</p>

\begin{align*}
0 &= 0 \\
1 &= S(0) \\
2 &= S(S(0)) \\
3 &= S(S(S(0))) \\
4 &= S(S(S(S(0)))) \\
\ldots
\end{align*}

<p>
Awkward? YMMV<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Your mileage may vary. 
</span>. But we have to admit we&rsquo;ve defined something akin
to the natural numbers using just the constant \(0\) and a successor
function applied to it. Now, let&rsquo;s define addition on this system. To
do this we&rsquo;ll use these two <i>identities</i>
</p>

\begin{align}
x + 0 &= x \\
x + s(y) &= s(x + y)
\end{align}

<p>
This should cover all possible cases of addition. Testing, let&rsquo;s add
\(1\) and \(2\;\) or \(s(0) + s(s(0))\;\)
</p>

\begin{align}
s(0) + s(s(0)) &= \\
s(s(0) + s(0)) &= \\
s(s(s(0)) + 0) &= s(s(s(0)))
\end{align}

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We apply (2) to (3) to get (4); in effect abstracting \(1+2\;\), the
left side of (2), to the <i>successor</i> of \(1+1\;\), the right side of
(2).</li>
<li>But now the inner part of (4), namely \(s(0) + s(0)\;\), resembles (2)
allowing us to match the first \(s(0)\) to \(x\) and the second to
\(s(y)\), which in turn allows us to rewrite it as \(s(s(0) +
  0)\;\).</li>
<li>But according to (1) \(s(0) + 0 = s(0)\;\;\), leaving \(s(s(0))\;\)</li>
<li>Including back in the outermost \(s\) we now have \(s(s(s(0)))\;\) our
answer.</li>
</ul>


<p>
What have we accomplished with this convoluted method? For one, we&rsquo;ve
reduced the entire idea of the natural numbers, along with adding two
of these reimagined natural numbers, to just a small set of symbols,
namely
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <i>constant</i> symbol \(0\)</li>
<li>variable symbols \(x\) and \(y\)</li>
<li>and a function symbol \(s\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
And with these four symbols we create statements made of <i>terms</i> built
from our symbols as in (1) and (2), e.g., \(x + 0\;\) is term, and
\(s(x + y)\;\) is another term. This allows us to state our problem as
terms, then <i>rewrite</i> these terms step-by-step as we did above to get
to a final term rewrite that is our answer. And so we have a <i>term
rewriting system</i> that provides addition of our natural
numbers<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Rewriting is basically what you do when you, e.g., take steps
to simplify or reduce a fraction. More on normal or canonical forms

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
In a sense, rewriting is at the heart of all formulations of
computability &#x2014; any computational device&rsquo;s fundamental behaviour is
to read symbols and generate other symbols, which amounts to rewriting
the input as the output.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
So what&rsquo;s the alternative? Your modern digital computer creates a
human-friendly world of numbers and addition with the help of base\(_{2}\)
binary numbers, computer circuit board logic gates, and lots and lots
of Assembler code to manage it all. Then come the higher languages
which present math as we normally see it, e.g., \(1 + 1 = 2\;\). When
seen in this light, we might begin to appreciate a very basic,
fundamental fact about modern computing, namely, <font color =
"#4715b3">we can create strategies to accomplish logical
calculations by manipulating (rewriting) <i>terms</i> built of
<i>symbols</i>.</font> Again, this adds a whole new dimension to
our age-old math world mix of scrolls, paper, books, pencils,
blackboards and chalk, and those mysterious mental representations of
math inside our human brains.

<p>
Simplistic as our natural number system in the previous section may
seem, there&rsquo;s actually quite a bit of math theory to unpack to really
understand what just happened. When we build a number up from repeated
or nested application of the successor function \(s\) we were using the
ideas of <i>induction</i> and <i>recursion</i><label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Again, this may seem very simplistic, but the idea of induction is
inherent to the natural numbers. So if \(\mathbb{N}\;\) is also referred
to as the counting numbers, then we count or <i>enumerate</i> things with

backstory. Note the formula is <br />
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{(number of pairs)} &sdot; \text{(sum of each pair)}}{2}
\end{align*} <br />
</span>, we&rsquo;re
attempting to <i>prove</i> it. So for example if we add the first three
numbers, according to the formula we should get \(6\;\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{(3)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{(12)}{2} = 6
\end{align*}

<p>
An induction proof is a two-step process: a <i>base case</i> and an
<i>induction step</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Base case</b>: \(P(0)\)
</p>

<p>
\(P(0)\;\) is trivial. Just plug in \(0\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{(0)(0+1)}{2} = \frac{(0\cdot1)}{2} = 0
\end{align*}

<p>
<b>Inductive step</b>: Now we have to consider \(n \gt 0\;\) cases. The whole
idea is to show that for any number \(k \ge 0\;\), if \(P(k)\;\) works, so
will \(P(k+1)\;\)
</p>

<p>
We start by assuming what is called the <i>induction hypothesis</i>, i.e.,
that our statement \(P\) will hold for \(P(n)\;\). Here we&rsquo;re saying for
the unique case when \(n = k\;\) that \(P(k)\;\) is true
</p>

\begin{align}
0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
\end{align}

<p>
Good. Now we want to consider \(P(k+1)\;\). We&rsquo;ll just add it on both
sides since it is the next step after \(k\;\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
(0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + k) + (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)
\end{align*}

<p>
Now, we consider just the right side of this equation and do some
algebraic manipulation
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) &= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2} \\
                         &= \frac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2}
                         &= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
                         &= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}  
\end{align*}

<p>
Going back to our original left-hand side
</p>

\begin{align}
(0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + k) + (k + 1) = \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}
\end{align}

<p>
Now, compare (6) with (7). On the left-hand side of (7) we have the
next step \((k+1)\;\) and on the right-hand side of (7) we have in the
numerator the &ldquo;number of pairs&rdquo; increased from \(k\;\) to \(k+1\;\) and
the &ldquo;sum of each pair&rdquo; likewise increased by \(1\;\) from \(k+1\) to \(k +
1 + 1\;\). Through algebraic manipulation we have proved that &ldquo;the next
one&rdquo; will indeed increase as we might want it to. For example, if we
total the first ten numbers
</p>

\begin{align*}
\text{Total sum} = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2}
\end{align*}

<p>
and totalling the next number \(11\) will just be
</p>

\begin{align*}
\text{Total sum} = \frac{11 \cdot 12}{2}
\end{align*}

<p>
which is covered in our proof for <i>any</i> \(k+1\;\).

If we have a relatively short list we can no doubt spot it, e.g.,

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgad3828f">
<p>
There is the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">unary numeral system</a></i> (UNS) where numbers are
represented in a <i>unary</i><label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="20" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Unfortunately, <i>unary</i> here has two meanings. It means we&rsquo;re
only using one numeral to do our counting, <i>and</i> it indicates a unary
function, i.e., a function that takes only one value and returns only
something from its domain&#x2014;which is a very abstract version of the
idea of a <i>unary operator</i> where only one thing is operated on. For
example, addition is a <i>binary operation</i> since it takes <i>two</i> numbers
and adds them. But making a number a negative number by placing the
negative sign in front of the number is an example of a unary
operation.
</span> way, e.g., one is \(1\), two is \(11\),
three is \(111\), et cetera. The UNS system is not really positional,
i.e., the column of a \(1\) is immaterial since the \(1\)&rsquo;s are completely
interchangeable&#x2014;although when we want to go up a number, we do have
to move everything over one column. But again, the columns do not
indicate anything numerically as columns do with, e.g., our decimal
system<label for="21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="21" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
More on the <i>binary</i> number system later.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
How would we add or subtract in our UNS system? Ironically, we could
invent a sort of columnar subtracting borrowing from decimal vertical
subtraction
</p>

\begin{array}{r}
&11111\\
-\!\!\!\!\!\!&11\\
\hline
&11100
\end{array}

<p>
then we just throw out the zeroes and count up the ones. But we can&rsquo;t
really do addition vertically. Perhaps not vertically but
horizontally
</p>

\begin{align*}
11111 + 11 = 1111111
\end{align*}

<p>
We could also remove the \(+\) and run together or <i>concatenate</i> the
\(1\)&rsquo;s. More on concatenation later.
</p>

<p>
Next, we write some Haskell code to do UNS subtraction<label for="22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="22" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Turning math into code means we must first decide which data structure
to use. For our string of \(1\)&rsquo;s we will use the Haskell <i>list</i> data
structure. This may seem ironic to a budding mathematician who
went down the set theory rabbit holes above. Yes, so much of math can
be seen as <i>set theory</i>-based. And no, a list is not a set. And yes,
Haskell has a library for sets. But as beginners we will simulate sets
with lists<label for="23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="23" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
We could also represent our \(1\)&rsquo;s as a string, i.e., like text
between double-quotes, but any string in Haskell is just a list of the
text&rsquo;s individual characters, e.g., <code>"1111"</code> is really just
<code>['1','1','1','1']</code>.
</span>. This means our set of \(1\)&rsquo;s will be represented as
a list with the integer \(1\) repeated as its elements, e.g.,
<code>[1,1,1,1,1]</code> is \(11111\).
</p>

<p>
First we&rsquo;ll try a really primitive way to do UNS subtraction
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Put \(1\)&rsquo;s into lists,</li>
<li>Apply the built-in list element counter function, <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/length_f.html">length</a>, on each to
count the number of \(1\)&rsquo;s in each,</li>
<li>Subtract one from the other.</li>

What <code>:i</code> or <code>:info</code> is saying about the typeclass <code>Eq</code> is that in

<code>(==)</code> and <code>(/=)</code>.

Now <code>unsSub4 :: (Eq a, Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code> restricts <code>a</code> to
being a value that has instances for <code>Eq</code> <i>and</i> <code>Num</code> registered. Why
is this important? Because without specifying, <i>anticipating</i> the
ability to perform equality (<code>Eq</code>) comparisons on only numerical
values (<code>Num</code>), other non-numerical values for <code>a</code> might give false
output. When we declare the function <code>unsSub4</code>&rsquo;s input and output
types with <code>unsSub4 :: (Eq a, Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>, we are
guaranteeing sane behavior.

As you saw in LYAHFGG, recursion is the Haskell way of looping. UNS
addition, as represented by lists, will be a simple matter of
combining two lists of <code>1</code>&rsquo;s into one total list. Borrowing from
above, we can start out very simple by concatenating the lists

<p>
<code>unsAdd1</code> gives a nice example of recursion. But what if any of the
list elements are negative <code>1</code>&rsquo;s? Let&rsquo;s say if the lists contain
<code>-1</code>&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll take away a positive <code>1</code>. One approach would be to just
concatenate both lists, then go through removing positive and negative
pairs

<p>
The UNS is considered a <i>bijective base-1 numeral system</i>. How is
<i>bijective</i> meant here? The answer is to imagine the set of all whole
numerals \(1,2,\ldots,\infin\;\), and then the set of all UNS 1-strings,
e.g., <code>1</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>111</code>. These two sets are mapped bijectively, as with
bijective functions. The term <i>unary</i> can be interpreted mainly as a
number system having only one digit. However, when we explore Peano
numbers, we will revisit the idea of unary functions and unary
operators.

Or we could say &ldquo;the number after
four.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s just the number after three&#x2014;and so on until we
arrive at zero, which we call, yes, zero, and write as \(0\). So in this
system, \(5\) would be&#x2026;

<font color = "#4715b3">
&#x2026;the next, next, next, next, next number after zero.

<p>
But just to check this for accuracy, we again fall back on numerical
symbols and names. So we count the number of <i>next</i>&rsquo;s and translate
this chain of next links back into \(5\).
</p>

<p>
So we seem to be stuck with names and symbols, our <i>numbering system</i>,
so to speak, to even get off the ground with numbers as representative
of amounts. However, mathematics will want to take us much further
into the conceptualization of numbers, abstractions far beyond the
simple notion of how many. In abstract algebra, operations on numbers
such as addition and subtraction have consequences beyond number names
or symbols. So the subtraction of one natural number from another is a
&ldquo;taking away&rdquo; of one amount from another. But what if we try to take
\(3\) from \(2\;\)? To take \(3\) from \(2\) would land us outside the
counting whole numbers \(\mathbb{N}\;\), would it not?  After all, \(2 -
3\) is \(-1\), i.e., we went past \(0\) and landed one tick below in
&ldquo;negative territory.&rdquo; The <i>integers</i> (denoted by \(\mathbb{Z}\))
abstracts \(\mathbb{N}\;\) by symmetrically mirroring, duplicating all
its positive whole numbers into their negative counterparts. However,
the operation of addition in \(\mathbb{N}\) would not ever take us into
negatives. Any two (sic) natural numbers we might add together would
produce another member of the natural numbers somewhere further up the
list of \(\mathbb{N}\;\). But now we&rsquo;re concerned with where in the
list. Hence, <i>order</i> is our next abstraction beyond just naming
amounts. And as you might suspect, the most basic ordering of numbers
is to &ldquo;line them up&rdquo; according to their amounts<label for="25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="25" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
How would you order a box of crayons? One way would be
by their colors. But is brown ahead or behind green? Crayon colors
don&rsquo;t seem to have an ahead or behind, maybe just a &ldquo;beside&rdquo; or &ldquo;along
with&rdquo; perhaps?
</span>.
</p>

<p>
When we played with the notion of <i>next</i> above, it was as if we
started by feeding a basic starting thing, a <i>zero</i>, into a <i>next
machine</i>, and out came &ldquo;the next thing after zero&rdquo;. We might have
noted that to be \(1\). Then if we feed our zero adorned with next into
the next machine again we get &ldquo;the <i>next</i>, next thing after zero&rdquo; And
we write that down somewhere as \(2\). In effect, we&rsquo;re constructing a
way to string ticks together into a chain, forging a new chain link
for each new tick. Then instead of having a name or symbol, we could
just show the whole chain. Odd and awkward?  But this is exactly what
the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (following up on work done by
the German mathematician Richard Dedekind) formulated in order to put
the notion of natural numbers on a more mathematically-sound footing.

To check whether two sets are the same one has to check that they have

If every member of a set \(A\) is also a member of set \(B\) we say that
\(A\) is a subset of \(B\), written as \(A \subseteq B\). If \(A \subseteq B\)
and \(B \subseteq A\) then it follows by the <i>principle of
extensionality</i> that \(A\) and \(B\) are the same set. Conversely, if \(A

Unfortunately, <i>unary</i> here has two meanings. It means we&rsquo;re
only using one numeral to do our counting, <i>and</i> it indicates a unary
function, i.e., a function that takes only one value and returns only
something from its domain&#x2014;which is a very abstract version of the
idea of a <i>unary operator</i> where only one thing is operated on. For
example, addition is a <i>binary operation</i> since it takes <i>two</i> numbers
and adds them. But making a number a negative number by placing the
negative sign in front of the number is an example of a unary
operation.

We could also represent our \(1\)&rsquo;s as a string, i.e., like text
between double-quotes, but any string in Haskell is just a list of the
text&rsquo;s individual characters, e.g., <code>"1111"</code> is really just
<code>['1','1','1','1']</code>.

How would you order a box of crayons? One way would be
by their colors. But is brown ahead or behind green? Crayon colors
don&rsquo;t seem to have an ahead or behind, maybe just a &ldquo;beside&rdquo; or &ldquo;along

<code>quot</code> returns the quotient, discards the remainder; <code>gcd</code> is
the built-in <i>greatest common divisor</i>; <code>signum</code> gives back <code>1</code> if
argument is greater than zero, <code>-1</code> if less than zero, zero if zero.

In number theory, a <i>perfect number</i> is a positive integer that
is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number
itself. For instance, \(6\) has divisors \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\) (excluding
itself), and \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\;\), so \(6\) is a perfect number.
